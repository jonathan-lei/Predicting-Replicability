<span class="sentence">When learning new words, do children use a speaker's eye gaze because it reveals referential intent? We conducted two experiments that addressed this question. </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 1, the experimenter left while two novel objects were placed where the child could see both, but the experimenter would be able to see only one. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter returned, looked directly at the mutually visible object, and said either, “There's the [novel word]!” or “Where's the [novel word].” </span><span class="sentence">Two- through 4-year-olds selected the target of the speaker's gaze more often on there trials than on where trials, although only the older children identified the referent correctly at above-chance levels on trials of both types. </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 2, the experimenter placed a novel object where only the child could see it and left while the second object was similarly hidden. </span><span class="sentence">When she returned and asked, “Where's the [novel word]?” 2- through 4-year-olds chose the second object at above-chance levels. </span><span class="sentence">Preschoolers do not blindly follow gaze, but consider the linguistic and pragmatic context when learning a new word.</span>
