<span class="sentence">Many objects typically occur in particular locations, and object words encode these spatial associations. </span><span class="sentence">We tested whether such object words (e.g., head, foot) orient attention toward the location where the denoted object typically occurs (i.e., up, down). </span><span class="sentence">Because object words elicit perceptual simulations of the denoted objects (i.e., the representations acquired during actual perception are reactivated), we predicted that an object word would interfere with identification of an unrelated visual target subsequently presented in the object's typical location. </span><span class="sentence">Consistent with this prediction, three experiments demonstrated that words denoting objects that typically occur high in the visual field hindered identification of targets appearing at the top of the display, whereas words denoting low objects hindered target identification at the bottom of the display. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, object words oriented attention to and activated perceptual simulations in the objects' typical locations. </span><span class="sentence">These results shed new light on how language affects perception.</span>
