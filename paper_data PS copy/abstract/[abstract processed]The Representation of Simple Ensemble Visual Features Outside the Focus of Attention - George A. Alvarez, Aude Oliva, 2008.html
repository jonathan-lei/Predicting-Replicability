<span class="sentence">The representation of visual information inside the focus of attention is more precise than the representation of information outside the focus of attention. </span><span class="sentence">We found that the visual system can compensate for the cost of withdrawing attention by pooling noisy local features and computing summary statistics. </span><span class="sentence">The location of an individual object is a local feature, whereas the center of mass of several objects (centroid) is a summary feature representing the mean object location. </span><span class="sentence">Three experiments showed that withdrawing attention degraded the representation of individual positions more than the representation of the centroid. </span><span class="sentence">It appears that information outside the focus of attention can be represented at an abstract level that lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the scene. </span><span class="sentence">The term ensemble features refers to a broad class of statistical summary features that we propose collectively make up the representation of information outside the focus of attention.</span>
