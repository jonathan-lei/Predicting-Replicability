<span class="sentence">Word-order rules impose major constraints on linguistic behavior. </span><span class="sentence">For example, adjectives appear before nouns in English, and after nouns in French. </span><span class="sentence">This means that constraints on word order must be language-specific properties upheld on-line by the language system. </span><span class="sentence">Despite the importance of these rules, little is known about how they operate. </span><span class="sentence">We report an influence of word order on the activation of phonological representations. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were presented with colored objects and asked to name either the colors or the objects; the phonological similarity between the object and color names was manipulated. </span><span class="sentence">French speakers showed a phonological congruency effect in color naming, but not in object naming. </span><span class="sentence">English participants yielded the opposite pattern: a phonological effect in object naming, but not in color naming. </span><span class="sentence">Differences in the typical order of nouns and adjectives in French and English provide a plausible account for this cross-linguistic contrast. </span><span class="sentence">More generally, these results provide direct evidence for the operation of word-order constraints during language production.</span>
