<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">METHOD</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">Each experiment began with a baseline motion-sensitivity task using moving-dot test stimuli. </span><span class="sentence">Following the baseline task, subjects viewed a series of implied-motion photographs interleaved with test trials of moving-dot probes. </span><span class="sentence">The dot probes were used to assess whether or not an MAE resulted from viewing the implied-motion photos. </span><span class="sentence">In the first experiment, subjects viewed pictures with implied motion to the left or to the right and were tested with dot displays containing leftward or rightward real motion, making two-alternative forced-choice judgments on the direction of dot motion (left or right). </span><span class="sentence">The second experiment was similar, except that after 50% of the picture sequences, selected at random, there was a 3-s delay between the offset of the last picture and the onset of the moving-dot test trial. </span><span class="sentence">This delay was introduced to test whether an MAE from implied motion, like MAEs from physical motion (Keck &amp; Pentz, 1977), would decay during a brief period following adaptation. </span><span class="sentence">In the third experiment, mirror-reversed pairs of implied-motion photographs were shown simultaneously side by side to create implied motion either toward fixation (“inward”) or away from fixation (“outward”). </span><span class="sentence">In all three experiments, subjects were instructed to attend to the pictures for a memory test following the experiment; there were no instructions to imagine or attend to the motion implied in the photographs. </span><span class="sentence">All subjects performed above chance levels on the old/new recognition memory test at the end of the experiment.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Participants and Equipment</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">All subjects (26, 19, and 32 for Experiments 1–3, respectively) were naive to the purpose of the experiments and were recruited from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology community. </span><span class="sentence">Subjects provided written consent and were paid for participation. </span><span class="sentence">They were seated approximately 40 cm away from the display, a CRT monitor with a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels (26 × 19.5 cm) and a refresh rate of 75 Hz.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Moving-Dot Test Stimuli</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">We used a standard moving-dot direction-discrimination task (Newsome &amp; Pare, 1988), which had previously been employed as a means to assess and quantify MAEs from adaptation to real motion (Blake &amp; Hiris, 1993). </span><span class="sentence">Random dot displays such as those used in this task have been important for studying visual motion systems because they do not contain recognizable features that can be used to infer a change in location over time, and are thus thought to rely on primary motion-processing mechanisms.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">In the first two experiments, each test stimulus consisted of 100 dots contained within a rectangular window whose length and width were 33% of the entire display (approximately 12° × 9° of visual angle). </span><span class="sentence">We manipulated the proportion of dots moving coherently in a particular direction (motion coherence) from trial to trial, and subjects were instructed to indicate the direction of global motion using a key press (left or right). </span><span class="sentence">On each frame, a subset of the dots, equal to the percentage of dots moving coherently for that trial, was selected to move either left or right. </span><span class="sentence">All other dots disappeared and randomly reappeared at any other location within the test window. </span><span class="sentence">A new set of dots was reselected for coherent movement on each frame, so that the trajectory of single dots could not be followed throughout a trial. </span><span class="sentence">Each 1-s test trial consisted of 25 frames displayed for 40 ms each. </span><span class="sentence">Dot displacement for coherent motion was approximately 0.05° per frame.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">In the third experiment, the test stimuli were identical, except that they consisted of 200 dots, 100 on each side of fixation (instead of 100 total), and they moved horizontally toward or away from the vertical midline (instead of left or right). </span><span class="sentence">By a key-press response, subjects indicated whether the dots appeared to move inward or outward. </span><span class="sentence">The window of the test stimulus was the same size as in the first two experiments, so the dot density was double.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Baseline Motion Sensitivity</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Prior to the adaptation phase of each experiment, subjects were tested on a baseline motion-calibration task, during which dot coherence ranged from 5% to 65% over 180 1-s trials consisting of 25 frames each; motion was either leftward or rightward in the first two experiments, and either inward or outward in the third experiment. </span><span class="sentence">A logistic function was fitted to the responses, with “leftward” or “outward” arbitrarily coded as negative coherence, and “rightward” or “inward” as positive coherence. </span><span class="sentence">For each subject, the amount of coherence corresponding to asymptotic performance (99% “rightward” or “inward” responses and 1% “rightward” or “inward” responses) was determined from the fitted logistic function. </span><span class="sentence">The average of the absolute value of these two values was considered the maximal dot coherence for each subject, and defined as 1 unit of normalized coherence. </span><span class="sentence">For each direction of motion, stimuli with 1 unit of normalized coherence and with 50% and 25% of this coherence value were used as test stimuli in the adaptation phase of the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">There were thus six different test stimuli per subject; within each block, the different stimuli were repeated an equal number of times, in random order. </span><span class="sentence">Across subjects, the mean for 1 unit of normalized coherence corresponded to 35% (<i>SD</i> = 14%) actual dot coherence.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Adaptation to Implied Motion</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">The adaptation stimuli were 103 color photographs with either leftward or rightward implied motion. </span><span class="sentence">The photos, found from Internet searches, depicted people, animals, or vehicles in motion. </span><span class="sentence">No photos contained text, and all photos were mirror-reversed so that they could be used for both directions of adaptation. </span><span class="sentence">Each image was centered on the screen, and its size was scaled to a fixed area of 200,000 pixels (about 130° squared), with the original aspect ratio maintained.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">In the first experiment, the direction of adaptation, left or right, was constant within a block, and there were 30 adaptation trials in each of six blocks. </span><span class="sentence">Each adaptation trial consisted of a sequence of pictures lasting either 60 s (1st trial in a block) or 6 s (other trials) and was followed by a moving-dot test trial (see <span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-figure2-j1467-9280200802080x">Fig. 2</span>). </span><span class="sentence">A sequence of pictures was generated by randomly sampling from the 103 photos without repeat until all photos were used, so that any picture was equally likely to follow every other picture. </span><span class="sentence">Pictures were shown every 545 ms, so that 110 photos were presented during the initial 60-s adaptation trial of each block, and 11 photos during each of the 6-s “top-up” adaptation trials. </span><span class="sentence">The initial adaptation trial and the 29 top-up trials in each block differed only in their duration.</span></p><div class="figure" id="figure2-j.1467-9280.2008.02080.x"><div class="holder"><img alt="&#10;

Adaptation consisted of viewing a succession of frozen-motion photographs with implied motion. Following 60 s of adaptation (the first trial per block), or 6 s of top-up adaptation, subjects made forced-choice judgments of the global direction of moving-dot test stimuli (25 frames presented over 1 s). The direction of adaptation varied randomly across six blocks. In the second experiment, there was a 3-s delay between the last picture shown on half the adaptation trials and the moving-dot test trial that came afterward.</p></div></div></div><p><span class="sentence">The second experiment was identical to the first except for the following differences. </span><span class="sentence">There were 36 adaptation trials per block instead of 30, and on 50% of these trials, there was a 3-s delay with a blank screen between the last adapting photo and the onset of the test trial. </span><span class="sentence">Also, the presentation rate was 200 ms per picture, instead of 545 ms.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">The adaptation procedure for the third experiment was the same as the procedure for the first experiment, except for the following differences. </span><span class="sentence">The 103 photos from the previous experiments were converted to gray scale and scaled to a fixed size of 512 by 768 pixels. </span><span class="sentence">Each picture and its mirror reversal were presented adjacently, such that the implied motion was either toward the center (inward) or away from the center (outward). </span><span class="sentence">Subjects were instructed to fixate a small spot (about 1°) at the border of the two images (see <span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-figure1-j1467-9280200802080x">Fig. 1b</span>). </span><span class="sentence">A pair of photos was shown every 427 ms, so that 140 pairs were seen during the initial 60-s adaptation trial and 14 were seen during the twenty-nine 6-s top-up trials.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Subject Exclusion</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">We excluded from analysis a small number of subjects who were likely to be guessing or otherwise unable to perform the direction-discrimination task. </span><span class="sentence">Two subjects from the first experiment, 1 subject from the second experiment, and 3 subjects from the third experiment performed poorly on the baseline motion-sensitivity task, such that 1 unit of normalized motion coherence for these subjects would have exceeded 100% dot coherence. </span><span class="sentence">These subjects were excluded from analysis. </span><span class="sentence">In the first experiment, 5 subjects' performance on the dot-discrimination task did not exceed chance. </span><span class="sentence">That is, a logistic fit to the data for these subjects indicated that the likelihood of judging a test stimulus as moving in a particular direction (right or left) did not increase significantly with increased dot coherence in that direction. </span><span class="sentence">These subjects were also excluded from analysis.</span></p>
