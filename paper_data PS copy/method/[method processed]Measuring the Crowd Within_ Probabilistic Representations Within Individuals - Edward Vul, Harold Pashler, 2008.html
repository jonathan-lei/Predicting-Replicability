<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">METHOD</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">We recruited 428 participants from an Internet-based subject pool and asked them eight questions probing their real-world knowledge (derived from <i>The World Factbook</i>, Central Intelligence Agency, 2007; e.g., “What percentage of the world's airports are in the United States?”). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to guess the correct answers. </span><span class="sentence">Half the participants were unexpectedly asked to make a second, different guess for each question immediately after completing the questionnaire (immediate condition); the other half made a second guess 3 weeks later (delayed condition), also without being given advance notice that they would be answering the questions a second time. </span><span class="sentence">It is important that neither group knew they would be required to furnish a second guess, as this precluded subjects from misinterpreting their task as being to specify the two endpoints of a range.</span></p>
