The letters were white, uppercase, and in 48-point Courier font. </span><span class="sentence">They were presented on a black background. </span><span class="sentence">With our resolution (1024 × 768), monitor (Viewsonic G90f), and viewing distance (roughly 50 cm), the letters subtended roughly 2.5° of visual angle.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">On each trial, two cues in the RSVP stream indicated which of the letters were targets. </span><span class="sentence">The cues were white annuli with an inner diameter of 2.8° and an outer diameter of 3.2°; thus, they appeared as rings around the cued letters. </span><span class="sentence">When a cue appeared, it was shown for 25 ms, concurrently with the target letter (see <span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-figure2-j1467-9280200802046x">Fig. 2</span>).</span></p><div class="figure" id="figure2-j.1467-9280.2008.02046.x"><div class="holder"><img alt="&#10;                        figure&#10;                    " src="/paper_data/img/10.1111_j.1467-9280.2008.02046.x-fig2.gif"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="captionLabel">Fig. 2.</span> Experimental design. On a given trial, all 26 English letters were presented in a random order without repetition. Annulus cues were presented simultaneously with the 2 letters designated as targets (T1 and T2). Subjects were asked to report the identities of the 2 cued letters in order. Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) varied across trials.</p></div></div></div><p><span class="sentence">Onset of the first cue (T1 onset) was randomly counterbalanced to occur equally often in Positions 6 through 10 in the RSVP stream. </span><span class="sentence">The delay between the first and second cues (T1-T2 SOA) was manipulated over 10 levels, from 1 to 10 items (83–833 ms).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">The experiment was programmed in Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997; Matlab 7, Windows XP).</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Procedure</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Each participant began the experiment with 2 practice trials that had a randomly selected T1-T2 SOA; the results of these trials were discarded. </span><span class="sentence">Following the practice trials, participants completed four blocks of 100 trials each.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Each block contained 2 instances of each of the 50 possible combinations of T1 onset (five levels: Positions 6–10) and T1-T2 SOA (10 levels: SOAs of 1–10 items). </span><span class="sentence">For instance, in a trial with T1 onset at Position 6 and a T1-T2 SOA of 4 items, the two cues would appear during the 6th and 10th items in the sequence. </span><span class="sentence">These conditions appeared in a random order within each block.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">At the end of each trial, subjects were asked to indicate which two letters they thought had been cued by the annuli. </span><span class="sentence">Subjects reported the letters by pressing the corresponding keys on the computer keyboard. </span><span class="sentence">Duplicate letters were not accepted, and subjects were told to report the first letter first and the second letter second. </span><span class="sentence">After each trial, subjects were told how many points they had earned (1 point possible for each target). </span><span class="sentence">In addition to receiving the flat rate of $10 for participation, participants were offered bonus cash awards for performance: $0.01 for each letter reported correctly (on average, subjects reported about 200 letters correctly, receiving a $2 bonus). </span><span class="sentence">This bonus was provided as an incentive for subjects to try to report the cued letters correctly, given the particularly difficult conditions.</span></p>
