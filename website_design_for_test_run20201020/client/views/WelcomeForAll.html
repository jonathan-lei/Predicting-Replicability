        Welcome to our science experiment task!

    <p>
    The social sciences are facing a replication challenge -- in recent replication efforts by independent research teams, a significant percentage of selected published social science studies failed to produce results in the same direction as in the original study.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p> We aim to evaluate the wisdom of crowds in predicting the replicability of social science studies. In this task, you will read selected materials from two published social science papers and answer some questions about the studies' accessibility and plausibility. With your help, we hope to improve the ability to forecast replications and identify effective tools to obtain confidence on social science claims.
    <br />
