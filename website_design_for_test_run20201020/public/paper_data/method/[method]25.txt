<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">MAIN STUDY: ATTRACTIVENESS OF MEN DESCRIBED AS SINGLE OR ATTACHED</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">Our main study was designed to test the predictions based on the assumptions that we validated in the preparatory study, namely, that women with a partner will prefer attached men during the less fertile days of their cycle and single men during the more fertile days of their cycle. </span><span class="sentence">On the basis of previous literature and theory, we also predicted that the high-fertility preference for single men will be strongest for men whose faces are more masculine than average. </span><span class="sentence">Additionally, after obtaining the results of the preparatory study, we predicted that the effect will tend to be strongest when the attached man is described as having a girlfriend, and weakest when he is described as married.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Method</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>Participants</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants were 220 nonpregnant women, 110 with and 110 without a partner. </span><span class="sentence">They were all students at the University of Padua, and were recruited and tested individually. </span><span class="sentence">Data from 12 participants were discarded from the analyses because at the end of the experiment these women reported using hormonal contraceptives (10) or not being heterosexual (2). (Unlike the question about having a partner, the latter two questions were asked at the end of the experiment, because at the start they might have seemed intrusive.) Thus, the final sample consisted of 208 women (median age = 21.6 years, range = 18–35 years).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Each woman's menstrual-cycle day was standardized by dividing the number of days since the first day of her last menstrual period by the reported typical cycle length and multiplying the quotient by 28. </span><span class="sentence">On the basis of this 28-day standardized cycle, the women were divided into a high-conception-risk group (Days 8–20, <i>n</i> = 97) and a low-conception-risk group (Days 1–7 and 21–28, <i>n</i> = 101). </span><span class="sentence">This subdivision resulted from applying the formula that, when only the onset of previous menstruation is known, has been shown to predict pregnancy probability across the menstrual cycle most accurately, that is, the average midcycle rule (Lamprecht &amp; Grummer-Strawn, 1996). </span><span class="sentence">Alternative splits, such as between high-estrogen (Days 12–21) and low-estrogen (Days 1–11 and 22–28) groups (Fisher, 2004), did not alter the results. </span><span class="sentence">Data from 10 women who were on standardized days between 29 and 35, and therefore likely to be experiencing an abnormal menstrual cycle, were excluded.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Stimuli</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">The stimuli were the male faces used in the preparatory study. </span><span class="sentence">The photographs were presented in an album, in a different random order for each participant. </span><span class="sentence">Each photo was accompanied by one of four possible labels: “this person is single,” “this person is in love,” “this person has a girlfriend,” and “this person is married.” </span><span class="sentence">Although the photographs were the same for all participants, four versions of the album were prepared so that each photo was paired (between subjects) with all four descriptions.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Procedure</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">The four album versions were presented to four groups of 55 participants each (in the final sample, these groups included 52, 52, 54, and 50 women). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were asked to imagine being at a party (with their partner, if they had one) and seeing the man portrayed in each photograph. </span><span class="sentence">They had to rate his attractiveness on an 11-point scale (0 = <i>not at all attractive</i>, 10 = <i>very attractive</i>). </span><span class="sentence">Before giving each rating, participants read aloud the description that accompanied the photograph. </span><span class="sentence">There was no time limit. </span><span class="sentence">At the end, participants completed a questionnaire that asked for basic demographic information and menstrual-cycle information, and also included several items concerning their current relationship, if they were romantically involved.</span></p>
