<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">METHOD</h2></div><div class="head-b"><h3>Participants</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Thirty White college students (20 male, 10 female) participated in the study in exchange for course credit. </span><span class="sentence">During a pretesting session, students (<i>N</i> ≅ 250) completed the Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice scale (Plant &amp; Devine, 1998). </span><span class="sentence">The External Motivation subscale of this instrument consists of five items (e.g., “Because of today's politically correct standards, I try to appear non-prejudiced toward Black people.”). </span><span class="sentence">Participants indicate their agreement on 9-point scales. </span><span class="sentence">Participants for this study were selected from among those students with External Motivation scores in the top (&gt; 4.7) or bottom (&lt; 3.8) third of the full pretesting sample (<i>Mdn</i> = 4.4). </span><span class="sentence">Although high-EM and low-EM participants obviously differed in external motivation (<i>M</i>s = 5.74 and 3.04), they did not differ in internal motivation<sup>1</sup> (<i>M</i>s = 5.32 and 4.97), <i>t</i>(27) = 0.34, <i>p</i><sub>rep</sub> &lt; .7.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Facial Stimuli</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Forty-eight faces were obtained from Park's Productive Aging Face Database (Minear &amp; Park, 2004); they were selected to match in age (18–29), but differ in race (White, Black) and affect (happy, neutral). </span><span class="sentence">Ten White undergraduates used 7-point Likert scales to rate these faces for happiness, emotional neutrality, and attractiveness. </span><span class="sentence">As expected, faces with neutral expressions were rated as more emotionless than smiling faces (<i>M</i>s = 5.4 and 2.1, respectively), <i>F</i>(1, 44) &gt; 400, <i>p</i><sub>rep</sub> &gt; .999, but as less happy than smiling faces (<i>M</i>s = 1.8 and 5.2, respectively), <i>F</i>(1, 44) &gt; 250, <i>p</i><sub>rep</sub> &gt; .999. </span><span class="sentence">These effects were not moderated by the race of the faces. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, happiness ratings of smiling Black and White faces did not differ, nor did emotionless ratings of neutral Black and White faces (<i>F</i>s &lt; 0.5). </span><span class="sentence">Similarly, perceived attractiveness did not vary as a function of race, facial affect, or their interaction (<i>F</i>s &lt; 0.5).</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Dot-Probe Task</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Each dot-probe trial began with a fixation point that was displayed for 1 to 3 s. Next, two faces were displayed at 6° on either side of fixation. </span><span class="sentence">When the two faces disappeared from the screen, a small gray dot appeared in the center of the screen location where one of them had previously appeared. </span><span class="sentence">The dot remained on the screen until the participant indicated its location by pressing either the “left” or the “right” key on a computer keyboard. </span><span class="sentence">For half of the trials, the face pairs appeared for 450 ms (long duration). </span><span class="sentence">For the other half, the face pairs appeared for 30 ms (short duration) and were replaced by a mask for 420 ms.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Participants were told that this task assesses visual attention and were asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible once the dot appeared. </span><span class="sentence">They completed 2 practice trials in which the word “FACE” appeared on either side of fixation, followed by 128 experimental trials. </span><span class="sentence">The experimental trials consisted of 64 critical trials, in which one Black and one White face were presented, embedded in an equivalent number of filler trials, in which either two White or two Black faces were presented. </span><span class="sentence">During each trial, both faces displayed either a happy facial expression or a neutral facial expression. </span><span class="sentence">Racial location of the dot (whether the dot was located where the White or Black face had previously appeared), facial expression of the stimuli (happy or neutral), presentation duration of the stimuli (30 ms or 450 ms), and dot position (right or left of fixation) were randomized across trials within four 32-trial blocks. </span><span class="sentence">All responses and latencies were recorded by the computer.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Procedure</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants were met and greeted in the laboratory by a White, female experimenter. </span><span class="sentence">After providing informed consent, they completed the dot-probe task on a Dell computer and were then debriefed, thanked, and credited for participating.</span></p>
