<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">EXPERIMENT 1: EXTREMAL EDGES FROM SHADING GRADIENTS</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">Experiment 1 examined depth and figural perception for simple bipartite displays that consisted of a central, straight contour separating two equal-sized, square regions that were aligned vertically or horizontally. </span><span class="sentence">In the conditions of primary interest, one side contained an EE along the shared contour, and the other side did not. </span><span class="sentence">The EE side always consisted of a luminance gradient that was perpendicular to the central contour (i.e., a gradient whose equiluminance contours were parallel to the edge) and formed the positive half of a sinusoid (see <span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-figure2-j1467-9280200802049x">Fig. 2</span>, left regions in the top row).<sup>4</sup> We used three different kinds of luminance patterns as non-EE regions to control for possible confounds: homogeneous regions that controlled for differences in mean luminance, textured regions that controlled for 2-D contrast structure, and convex non-EE regions that controlled for 3-D convexity (see <span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-figure2-j1467-9280200802049x">Fig. 2</span>).</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Method</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>Participants</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Nine students at the University of California, Berkeley, volunteered to participate in exchange for partial course credit in an undergraduate psychology course. </span><span class="sentence">All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Apparatus</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Displays were generated on a 15-in. </span><span class="sentence">Sony Vaio computer and presented on its LCD screen (size = 20.5 cm × 33 cm, resolution = 1280 × 800 pixels). </span><span class="sentence">Except for the displays on the screen, the room was dark. </span><span class="sentence">The observer's head was stabilized using a chin rest, and the screen was perpendicular to the line of sight. </span><span class="sentence">The size of the images, including a random-dot frame, was 10 cm × 16 cm (∼10° × 16° at 57 cm). </span><span class="sentence">Presentation and response collection were controlled by a MATLAB program (Mathworks Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) using routines from the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997).</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Design</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Simple bipartite displays were constructed using MATLAB. </span><span class="sentence">The two parts of each display were constructed by joining two square regions (6.4 cm × 6.4 cm) along a horizontal edge in the vertically oriented displays and along a vertical edge in the horizontally oriented displays. </span><span class="sentence">The luminance pattern of each square region was one of the seven types (see <span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-figure2-j1467-9280200802049x">Fig. 2</span>): a convex region with an EE along the shared edge, an equally convex region with no EE along the shared edge, a textured region that consisted of randomized strips of the EE display, a textured region that contained randomly positioned black and white dots, and uniform gray regions at 75%, 50%, and 25% of maximum luminance. </span><span class="sentence">In both the horizontal and the vertical displays, we paired all possible nonidentical combinations, including versions that were left-right and up-down reflections. </span><span class="sentence">All pairs were surrounded by a rectangular random-noise field measuring 10 cm × 16 cm. </span><span class="sentence">The experiment had a fully within-subjects design in which each participant saw four replications of each display. </span><span class="sentence">Trials were blocked by display orientation (vertical vs. horizontal), but all other factors were randomly intermixed.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Procedure</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">The experiment was approved by the committee for the protection of human subjects at the University of California, Berkeley, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to press the appropriate key on a computer keyboard to indicate the side in each display that appeared closer. </span><span class="sentence">The response mappings were the natural ones: the left or right arrow key for horizontal displays and the up or down arrow key for vertical displays. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were given 10 practice trials followed by four blocks of experimental trials and were allowed to take a break after any trial.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Each trial began with the presentation of a 10-cm × 16-cm random-dot field containing a large fixation cross centered on a 50%-gray screen. </span><span class="sentence">The participant pressed a key to view the target display, which was then presented for 2 s. The target display was replaced by a random-dot field containing a large question mark, which prompted the participant to indicate which region appeared closer and figural. </span><span class="sentence">The question mark disappeared when the observer responded and was replaced by the random-dot field containing the large fixation cross, which indicated the start of the next trial.</span></p>
