At the beginning of each trial, eight items appeared; four of the items were identified as targets by flashing on and off. Then all items moved about the display, and participants counted the total number of times a target circle touched a red line. At an unpredictable time between 6 and 10 s from the onset of motion, there was a 200-ms blank interval, followed by a final test display consisting of stationary items. Either one item was missing (a randomly selected target or distractor) or four items were missing (all the targets or all the distractors). A single digit at the center of the display informed participants of how many items were missing. Participants indicated where the missing item or items were located, clicking directly on the location of a single missing item or on the centroid of four missing items.</p></div></div></div><div class="head-b"><h3>Procedure</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>Test Phase</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants performed a multiple-object-tracking task followed by a missing-item localization task (see <span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-figure1-j1467-9280200802098x">Fig. 1</span>). </span><span class="sentence">At the start of each trial, eight circles appeared, and four of these items were identified as tracking targets by flashing off and on for 2 s. Next, all items moved for a random duration between 6 and 10 s. The primary task was to attentively track the targets, counting the number of times a target item touched or crossed one of the red lines. </span><span class="sentence">Participants kept one running count collapsed across all targets. </span><span class="sentence">This task was attentionally demanding and ensured that participants were continuously focusing their attention on the target items.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">At the end of each trial, all the circles disappeared for 200 ms, and then some reappeared. </span><span class="sentence">In the <i>individual-test</i> condition, either a single target or a single distractor was missing from the final display. </span><span class="sentence">In the <i>centroid-test</i> condition, either all four targets or all four distractors were missing. </span><span class="sentence">A cue that appeared at the center of the screen informed participants of how many items were missing (“1” for individual tests, “4” for centroid tests). </span><span class="sentence">Participants used the mouse to move a crosshair and clicked either on the location of the single missing item or on the location corresponding to the centroid of the four missing items. </span><span class="sentence">After clicking on the selected position, participants typed in the number of times targets had touched the red lines during the trial. </span><span class="sentence">Although participants entered this number second, they were instructed that the counting task was their primary task, and that they should not sacrifice accuracy on the counting task to perform the localization task. </span><span class="sentence">There were 80 trials, with conditions randomly intermixed.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Guessing Phase</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">After the test phase, participants completed a guessing phase, in which they were not required to track any targets. </span><span class="sentence">They were simply shown test displays with either one or four items missing, and were asked to guess where they thought the missing item or items were located. </span><span class="sentence">These displays were generated in the same way as in the test phase, but participants were shown only the final frame. </span><span class="sentence">The data from this phase provided an estimate of how well participants could guess where the missing items were located on the basis of the configuration of the items present in the test display, providing an empirical estimate of chance performance.</span></p>
