<span class="sentence">Previous research has shown that the detectability of a local change in a visual image is essentially independent of the complexity of the image when the interstimulus interval (ISI) is very short, but is limited by a low-capacity memory system when the ISI exceeds 100 ms. In the study reported here, listeners made same/different judgments on pairs of successive “chords” (sums of pure tones with random frequencies). </span><span class="sentence">The change to be detected was always a frequency shift in one of the tones, and which tone would change was unpredictable. </span><span class="sentence">Performance worsened as the number of tones increased, but this effect was not larger for 2-s ISIs than for 0-ms ISIs. </span><span class="sentence">Similar results were obtained when a chord was followed by a single tone that had to be judged as higher or lower than the closest component of the chord. </span><span class="sentence">Overall, our data suggest that change detection is based on different mechanisms in audition and vision.</span>
