<span class="sentence">We recently proposed that human memory systems are “tuned” to remember information that is processed for survival, perhaps as a result of fitness advantages accrued in the ancestral past. </span><span class="sentence">This proposal was supported by experiments in which participants showed superior memory when words were rated for survival relevance, at least relative to when words received other forms of deep processing. </span><span class="sentence">The current experiments tested the mettle of survival memory by pitting survival processing against conditions that are universally accepted as producing excellent retention, including conditions in which participants rated words for imagery, pleasantness, and self-reference; participants also generated words, studied words with the intention of learning them, or rated words for relevance to a contextually rich (but non-survival-related) scenario. </span><span class="sentence">Survival processing yielded the best retention, which suggests that it may be one of the best encoding procedures yet discovered in the memory field. </span>
