        <div style="clear: both;"></div>
        <h5> Our experiment consists of 3 independent rounds. In each round, you are given 5 real-world events to forecast. For each event, you need to specify a number between 0 and 1 representing how likely you think the event will happen. 
        <br>
        An example event is as follows:</h5>
        <form id="exampleForm" onSubmit="return false">
            <table id="taskTable" border="1" class="tasktable" align="center" style="border-spacing: 1px">
                {{#each tasks}} {{>taskBrier}} {{/each}}
            </table>
        </form>
        <br>
        <h4><strong> Forecasting Game Rules</strong></h4>
        <h5>
        For each event, you are participating in a single-player forecasting game. You can win bonus payment based on your decisions and the furture event outcome. The exact reward mechanism is introduced on the next page. <strong> When making your decisions, you are allowed to use any resource / method,</strong> such as searching the Internet and asking others. </h5>
