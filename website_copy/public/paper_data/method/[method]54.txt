<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">STUDY 1</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">Study 1 was an initial test of our hypothesis that more dominant individuals would be faster to respond to spatial targets along the vertical dimension of space. </span><span class="sentence">We ensured that attention was centered, both vertically and horizontally, at the start of each trial by presenting a centering prime that the participant was required to categorize. </span><span class="sentence">Immediately after this categorization response, a spatial probe appeared in one of four randomly determined positions on the screen—up, down, left, or right. </span><span class="sentence">Because we used a centering prime (akin to a fixation), along with a nearly instantaneous presentation of the probe following the response to the prime, performance reflected covert orienting, according to the spatial attention literature (Pashler, 1998; Posner, 1978).</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Method</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>Participants</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants in Study 1 were 43 undergraduates (20 females, 23 males) from North Dakota State University. </span><span class="sentence">They received extra credit for their classes.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Personality Dominance and Preliminary Analyses</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">We administered a 21-item personality-dominance scale from the International Personality Item Pool (Goldberg et al., 2006). </span><span class="sentence">This scale uses statements to assess personality dominance (e.g., “impose my will on others,” “want to control the conversation”). </span><span class="sentence">Responses are made on a scale from 1 ( <i>very inaccurate</i>) to 5 ( <i>very accurate</i>). </span><span class="sentence">In our sample, internal reliability was good (α = .70); the mean and standard deviation were 3.06 and 0.42, respectively. </span><span class="sentence">The attention task was completed before the assessment of trait dominance to preclude the possibility that completing the trait scale first might influence performance in the implicit task (Robinson &amp; Neighbors, 2006).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">In no cases did participants' sex modify the findings reported here, all <i>F</i>s &lt; 1, so we have collapsed across this variable. </span><span class="sentence">Also, we note that analyses examining possible Dominance × Vertical Location (up vs. down) and Dominance × Horizontal Location (left vs. right) interactions yielded nonsignificant results ( <i>p</i>s &gt; .10). </span><span class="sentence">We have therefore also collapsed across up and down locations in quantifying vertical performance and across left and right locations in quantifying horizontal performance.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Spatial Attention Task</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">The task was presented on a computer screen. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told that the spatial probe would always appear within a prominent, white-outlined box that was 11.75 in. high by 11.75 in. wide. </span><span class="sentence">All spatial probes were presented half an inch from the relevant border of the box.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">The task was simple: As quickly and accurately as possible, participants indicated whether the letter <i>p</i> or <i>q</i> was presented, by pressing the corresponding key of the keyboard (spatial attention paradigms are typically this simple: Pashler, 1998). </span><span class="sentence">Correct responses were followed by a 200-ms blank interval, whereas incorrect responses were followed by the message “Incorrect!” which was presented for 1,500 ms in order to encourage a high degree of accuracy. </span><span class="sentence">To center fixation prior to the appearance of the spatial probes, and thereby ensure that every trial involved the same centered attentional focus, we included an initial task in which participants had to categorize a centrally presented stimulus as either a letter ( <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, or <i>C</i>) or a number ( <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, or <i>3</i>). </span><span class="sentence">Responses were made by pronouncing “letter” or “number” into a voice key. </span><span class="sentence">When the oral response was registered, the central fixation stimulus disappeared and was immediately followed by a spatial probe (i.e., the letter <i>p</i> or <i>q</i>) that appeared in one of the four locations, determined randomly. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, the task assessed spontaneous favoring of one dimension over the other (horizontal vs. vertical) in covert-attention processes. </span><span class="sentence">There were 200 trials, 100 with vertical probes and 100 with horizontal probes. </span><span class="sentence">The vertical probes were horizontally centered on the screen and appeared above and below the central fixation point; the horizontal probes were vertically centered on the screen and appeared left and right of the central fixation point.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">In calculating latency scores, we followed general recommendations in the literature. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, we eliminated from consideration trials on which the response was incorrect (mean accuracy = 94%) and log-transformed latencies to reduce skew; outliers more than 2.5 standard deviations above and below the mean were replaced with these 2.5- <i>SD</i> cutoff values (Robinson, 2007). </span><span class="sentence">Latencies on trials with vertical spatial probes were averaged to obtain vertical-dimension scores, whereas latencies on trials with horizontal spatial probes were averaged to obtain horizontal-dimension scores.</span></p>
