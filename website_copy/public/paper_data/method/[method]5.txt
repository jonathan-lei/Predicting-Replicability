<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Experiment 1</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The aim of Experiment 1 was to replicate Stark and McClelland's (2000) finding of priming for items judged new and then apply the model to the data. </span><span class="sentence">An experimental replication was conducted rather than simply fitting the model to Stark and McClelland's data because robust demonstrations of priming in the absence of awareness remain elusive, and independent replications of such effects are therefore important.  We presented words at study using the CID procedure; participants pressed a button when they could identify the word and then named the word aloud. </span><span class="sentence">At test, we presented old and new words to participants using the CID-R procedure.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Twenty-four individuals were recruited through a University College London participant database. </span><span class="sentence">Their ages ranged from 19 to 38 years, with a mean of 23.3 years. </span><span class="sentence">All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision, reported English as their first language, were tested individually in sound-dampened cubicles, and were paid £4 (approximately $7) in return for taking part. </span><span class="sentence">The experiment was fully automated, and the experimenter was not present in the room during the course of the experiment.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A total of 120 words were selected with similar constraints to Stark and McClelland (2000): All words had four letters, had a frequency of occurrence of 10–200 per million (Kucera &amp; Francis, 1967), and had a maximum score of 500 on the Imagability and Concreteness scales in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981). </span><span class="sentence">All words were presented in white 20-pt Courier font. </span><span class="sentence">Two 50-word lists were constructed. </span><span class="sentence">Each word list acted as the old or new stimuli, counterbalanced across participants.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">At study, a single word was presented on each CID trial. </span><span class="sentence">At the start of each trial, a mask (a row of hash marks ####) was presented for 500 ms to orient the participant. </span><span class="sentence">Next, a word was presented in lowercase 20-pt Courier font for 17 ms. </span><span class="sentence">The mask was then presented in 26-pt Courier font for 233 ms, forming a 250-ms presentation block. </span><span class="sentence">The word was then immediately presented again, but this time the exposure duration was increased by 17 ms, and the mask followed for the remainder of the 250-ms presentation block. </span><span class="sentence">Presentation continued in this way, with the total stimulus plus mask time remaining constant in each block, until the mask duration was 0 ms (15 blocks). </span><span class="sentence">When a response was made (by clicking the left mouse button), the mask was immediately presented for 2,000 ms. </span><span class="sentence">Participants then clicked a button that was presented below the stimulus presentation area to advance to the next trial.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">There were 70 study trials in total. </span><span class="sentence">The first and last 10 trials were considered primacy and recency filler trials, and none of the words from these trials appeared at test. </span><span class="sentence">The RTs from these filler trials were not included in any subsequent analysis. </span><span class="sentence">The remaining 50 trials contained the stimuli that would later appear at test. </span><span class="sentence">For the study phase, participants were told that a word would flash on the screen for longer and longer durations and that this would make it appear clearer over time. </span><span class="sentence">They were told that they must click the left mouse button when they knew the identity of the word and then read it aloud. </span><span class="sentence">On each trial, the time from the onset of the stimuli to the onset of the button press was recorded. </span><span class="sentence">The importance of speed was emphasized; however, errors were discouraged: Participants were told that they should click the mouse button only when they were confident that they could identify the word correctly. </span><span class="sentence">If the word had not been identified by the end of the trial, then a message appeared to the participants asking them to try to be faster on the next trial. </span><span class="sentence">RTs longer than 3,750 ms (the time that had elapsed by the end of the last stimulus presentation block) were not recorded. </span><span class="sentence">No indication of the upcoming recognition test was given.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After the study phase, the instructions for the test phase were presented. </span><span class="sentence">We presented a single word using the CID procedure on each test trial. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were again instructed to press the mouse button when they could identify the word and then read the word aloud; they were additionally told that after identifying each word they would have to make a judgment about the word. </span><span class="sentence">After each identification, the probe “old or new?” appeared on the screen, and two buttons labeled “old” and “new” were also presented on the screen below this probe. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to click the button labeled “old” if they thought that the word they had just identified was one from the study phase. </span><span class="sentence">They were told to click the “new” button if they thought that the word had not been presented in the study phase. </span><span class="sentence">There were 100 test trials in total (50 old and 50 new trials). </span><span class="sentence">The selection of a word for each trial was randomly determined. </span><span class="sentence">Misidentification trials at study or test were excluded from all subsequent analysis. </span><span class="sentence">Responses were recorded on a tape recorder and later checked for accuracy.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">An alpha level of .05 was used for statistical tests, and <em>t</em> tests were two-tailed. </span><span class="sentence">We used the Greenhouse–Geisser correction to correct for nonsphericity on tests involving repeated measures factors with more than two levels.</span></p>
