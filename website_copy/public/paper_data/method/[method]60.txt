<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Study 1––Counterfactuals in the Classroom</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Study 1 sought to provide initial evidence for the use of upward counterfactuals as excuses in a situation in which individuals would be motivated by self-protection concerns. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, participants generated counterfactual thoughts following a midterm examination in their psychology course in which a lack of study effort could have served as a self-handicap. </span><span class="sentence">Individuals reporting low preparatory effort for the course exam were expected to generate more upward counterfactual thoughts about their effort relative to those reporting high preparatory effort for the exam. </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, controlling for reported effort, individuals were expected to experience higher self-esteem as a result of generating upward counterfactuals about a lack of effort. </span><span class="sentence">Given that past work has shown that upward counterfactuals involve a tradeoff of increased negative affect for increased preparative intentions and performance (Markman et al., 1993; Myers &amp; McCrea, 2008; Roese, 1994), individuals using upward counterfactuals to excuse a poor performance should experience less dissatisfaction and therefore be less motivated to improve in the future. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, individuals generating more upward counterfactuals about effort should report higher intentions to prepare in the future but only when these thoughts are accompanied by lower self-esteem. </span><span class="sentence">These effects of counterfactual thinking were expected to be limited to those specifically related to the handicap. </span><span class="sentence">Given that other counterfactuals are likely to mutate a mix of external and internal, stable and unstable factors, no predictions were made with regard to the effects of thoughts unrelated to the handicap for self-esteem or subsequent motivation.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Finally, attributions to effort were measured to assess whether effects of counterfactual thinking occurred independently of causal attribution. </span><span class="sentence">Based on previous research showing that counterfactual thinking and attribution are related but independent processes (Mandel, 2003; Mandel &amp; Lehman, 1996), it was predicted that effort attributions would show similar effects but would not account for the effects of counterfactuals concerning the handicap.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were 125 (35 men, 90 women) Indiana University students in two sections of a social psychology course who participated in return for extra credit in the course. </span><span class="sentence">There was no mention of self-handicapping or counterfactual thought in either class. </span><span class="sentence">Both sections used the same text, the same test format, and the same timing of the test.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Study 1 involved three sessions, following the methods of McCrea and Hirt (2001). </span><span class="sentence">The first session occurred at the beginning of the semester. </span><span class="sentence">The second occurred approximately 1 week before a midterm exam in the course. </span><span class="sentence">The third occurred approximately 1 week after the exam, immediately after participants learned their score.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Session 1</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were told that the experimenters were interested in how students at large and small universities prepare for exams. </span><span class="sentence">They completed a detailed informed consent form and were assured their responses would be kept confidential, being identified only by a unique code. </span><span class="sentence">They were asked to complete a personality profile that included Rosenberg's (1965) self-esteem measure, answering on a 1 ( <em>strongly agree</em>) to 7 ( <em>strongly disagree</em>) scale.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Session 2</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were told that the researchers were interested in a number of factors, such as class size, that might influence how students prepare for tests. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were asked to complete several demographic measures, to provide their most recent GPA (high school or college) and college entrance exam scores (on a scale ranging from 1 = <em>&lt;600 SAT</em> or <em>&lt;18 ACT</em> to 10 = <em>1500–1600 SAT</em> or <em>34–36 ACT</em>), and to complete several items concerning the characteristics of their class and the instructor to solidify the cover story.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Session 3</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The final session occurred immediately after participants learned their score on the test. </span><span class="sentence">Participants indicated their score (percent correct) on the exam. </span><span class="sentence">They were then asked to list any thoughts they had about their test score. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, there were no explicit instructions concerning counterfactual thoughts. </span><span class="sentence">Participants then were asked whether their performance was due to their amount of effort, rated on a scale ranging from 1 ( <em>disagree very much</em>) to 7 ( <em>agree very much</em>), and completed a measure of mood and self-esteem. </span><span class="sentence">They indicated to what extent they felt each of 30 mood and self-esteem adjectives (adapted from McFarland &amp; Ross, 1982) at that moment using a 1 ( <em>not at all</em>) to 7 ( <em>very much</em>) scale.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">They next indicated how much effort they had put into studying for the exam (see also McCrea &amp; Hirt, 2001). </span><span class="sentence">Participants completed measures assessing how much they had read the textbook, attended office hours, went to review sessions, used flash cards, asked the instructor questions, and asked other students questions. </span><span class="sentence">They responded to these items using a 0 ( <em>not at all</em>) to 6 ( <em>great deal</em>) scale. </span><span class="sentence">They also indicated how hard they had studied overall on a 1 ( <em>not at all</em>) to 7 ( <em>very much</em>) scale and reported how many days before the exam they had studied. </span><span class="sentence">Finally, participants reported their intentions to study for the next exam in the class using the same items. </span><span class="sentence">At the end of the final session, the full purpose of the experiment, reason for the use of deception, and expected results were discussed with participants. </span><span class="sentence">The confidentiality of their responses was again stressed.</span></p>
