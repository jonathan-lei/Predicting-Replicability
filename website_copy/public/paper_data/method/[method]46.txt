Kotler-Cope, 1989). </span><span class="sentence">For this reason, learning in this task is considered largely implicit.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Awareness Probes.</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">After participants completed the implicit-learning task, we assessed their knowledge of the relation between the number of employees and the factory's production (henceforth, the structure). </span><span class="sentence">Previous research with this paradigm utilized two different methods of assessing knowledge (e.g., Berry &amp; Broadbent, 1984, 1987), and we used both. </span><span class="sentence">First, we asked participants to describe, in their own words, what determined sugar production. </span><span class="sentence">They were offered a monetary bonus for a correct description. </span><span class="sentence">These descriptions were scored on the following scale: 0 = no knowledge, 1 = partial knowledge, 2 = complete knowledge. </span><span class="sentence">Next, participants were given five prediction problems. </span><span class="sentence">Each provided information about the current production and number of employees and the required target production for the next trial. </span><span class="sentence">The task was to determine the number of employees needed to achieve the target. </span><span class="sentence">Participants with perfect knowledge of the rule should have been completely successful. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, this measure of explicit knowledge ranged from 0 (no correct answer) to 5 (all answers correct).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Participants also answered items about their motivation. </span><span class="sentence">Two of these items assessed their explicit motivation to perform the task: “How important was it for you to succeed in this task?” and “How important was it for you to find a strategy that would allow you to control the factory?” </span><span class="sentence">The third item assessed participants' intention to learn the structure by asking them how important it was to “learn the rule by which the factory operated.” </span><span class="sentence">Ratings were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 ( <i>not at all important</i>) to 9 ( <i>very important</i>).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Finally, three items assessed whether participants believed the cover story, and whether they had any suspicion regarding the priming manipulation. </span><span class="sentence">First, they were asked to speculate, in their own words, on “the purpose of the word-search task” (which served as the priming manipulation). </span><span class="sentence">Next, they were asked “whether there was anything noteworthy in the word-search task,” and last, they were asked directly whether the word-search task had affected their performance on the sugar-factory task in any way.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Measure of Learning</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">As the sugar-factory paradigm introduces a completely novel environment, all participants begin the task with equal ignorance. </span><span class="sentence">Given that this environment is dynamic, one's level of performance depends on one's depth of learning. </span><span class="sentence">Hence, our main dependent measure was the number of times participants attained the production target (e.g., Berry &amp; Broadbent, 1987; Dienes &amp; Fahey, 1998; Hayes &amp; Broadbent, 1988). </span><span class="sentence">A trial was scored as on target when participants attained the target production level plus or minus 1,000 T (cf. Berry &amp; Broadbent, 1984).</span></p>
