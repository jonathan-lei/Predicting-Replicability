Estimation of stop signal reaction time (RT) according to a race model (Logan, 1994; Logan &amp; Cowan, 1984). The curve depicts the distribution of RTs on choice trials (trials without a stop signal), which represent the finishing times of the response processes. If independence of choice and stop processes is assumed, the finishing time of the stop process bisects the choice RT distribution. Given that the button-press response could be withheld in 50% of stop trials, stop signal RT (200 ms) is calculated by subtracting the mean stop signal delay (100 ms) from the median choice RT (300 ms).</em></span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Thirty-two healthy young adults served as participants for partial fulfillment of course credit or for a financial reward and constituted the two language groups: monolingual and bilingual. </span><span class="sentence">All reported having normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and all were unfamiliar with the purpose of the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">Half of the participants were monolingual Spanish speakers who lived in Spain, and the other half were Dutch–English bilinguals who lived in the Netherlands. </span><span class="sentence">All participants were tested by the same instructional protocols, although the actual testing was carried out in two different countries. </span><span class="sentence">The bilingual participants grew up in “mixed” families (with one parent speaking Dutch and the other speaking English or German), and some of them had lived part of their life in an English-speaking country. </span><span class="sentence">They used both Dutch and English on a daily basis throughout their lives. </span><span class="sentence">As research with bilingual adults (Kroll &amp; Stewart, 1994) and children (Bialystok, 1988) has revealed that the cognitive and linguistic consequences of bilingualism are more salient for those bilinguals who are relatively balanced in their proficiency, we considered only balanced bilinguals for the present study. </span><span class="sentence">The monolingual Spanish speakers were not functionally fluent in any other language, despite the inevitable language courses in school. </span><span class="sentence">All participants in both groups attended university and shared similar middle-class socioeconomic backgrounds, and they were matched for age, gender, and IQ (measured by Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices; see Table 1).</span><br/><br/> <span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-2-302-tbl1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-302-tbl1a.gif"/><em>Demographic Data Measures and Standard Deviations for the Monolingual (Mon) and Bilingual (Bil) Groups</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus and stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The Spanish participants were tested with a laptop PC (Asus A3Ac with a 15.1-in. monitor), and the Dutch participants were tested with a desktop PC (Switch attached to a Philips 17-in. </span><span class="sentence">Real Flat monitor). </span><span class="sentence">Responses were made by pressing the <em>Z</em> or <em>?</em> keys of the <em>QWERTY</em> computer keyboard with the left and right index finger, respectively. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were required to react quickly and accurately by pressing the left or right key in response to the direction of a left- or right-pointing green arrow (choice trials) about 3.5 × 2.0 cm in length.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment consisted of a 30-min session, in which participants completed a version of the task adopted from van den Wildenberg et al.
