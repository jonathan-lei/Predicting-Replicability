(2005) feature norm database. </span><span class="sentence">These items were chosen to present the strongest test of feature-based representations. </span><span class="sentence">For the lexical decision test, 532 pronounceable nonwords were created that were matched in length to the words, and the items were divided into two lists of 532 items each (266 words, 266 nonwords) to keep the overall number of trials per participant equal for the two tasks and avoid fatigue effects.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Stimuli were presented visually in 18-point black Courier font on a white computer screen background using E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). </span><span class="sentence">We used a 17 in. </span><span class="sentence">(43.18 cm) cathode ray tube monitor with a refresh rate of 100 Hz and a resolution set to 800 Ã— 600 pixels. </span><span class="sentence">Each trial began with a central fixation cross on screen for 1 s, then the stimulus was presented centered horizontally and vertically and remained on screen until the participant responded (or until 5 s had elapsed). </span><span class="sentence">Each participant completed either the lexical decision version of the experiment or the semantic categorization version. </span><span class="sentence">These tasks were chosen to examine basic word-recognition accuracy and latency in one task that requires semantic access (semantic categorization) and one task that, in principle, does not (lexical decision). </span><span class="sentence">The experiment was completed in one session lasting approximately 20 min. </span><span class="sentence">Before beginning the critical block, participants completed a 20-trial practice session. </span><span class="sentence">In the lexical decision task, participants were asked to indicate whether each item was a word; in the semantic categorization task, the participants were asked to indicate whether each word referred to a living thing or a nonliving thing.</span></p>
