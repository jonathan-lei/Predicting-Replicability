Dunlosky, 2004); we chose a typical member from each of 30 unique categories. </span><span class="sentence">Five additional words, selected according to the same criteria, were presented as practice words. </span><span class="sentence">Across all six conditions, the same words were presented in the same randomly determined order. </span><span class="sentence">A simple between-subjects design was used.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">In all conditions with the exception of the intentional-learning condition, participants rated individual words using a 5-point scale. </span><span class="sentence">Presentation of the words was followed by a short retention interval (filled with a digit recall task), and then memory was tested through free recall. </span><span class="sentence">For all groups with the exception of the intentional-learning group, the memory test was unexpected. </span><span class="sentence">All aspects of the design, including the form and timing of stimulus presentation, remained the same across conditions.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Procedure</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">On arrival at the laboratory, participants were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions. </span><span class="sentence">The instructions and the rating scales were as follows:</span></p><ul class="NLM_list-list_type-bullet" id="list1-j.1467-9280.2008.02064.x"><li><p><span class="sentence"><i>Survival</i>. “In this task, we would like you to imagine that you are stranded in the grasslands of a foreign land, without any basic survival materials. </span><span class="sentence">Over the next few months, you'll need to find steady supplies of food and water and protect yourself from predators. </span><span class="sentence">We are going to show you a list of words, and we would like you to rate how relevant each of these words would be for you in this survival situation. </span><span class="sentence">Some of the words may be relevant and others may not—it's up to you to decide.” </span><span class="sentence">The rating scale ranged from 1 ( <i>totally irrelevant</i>) to 5 ( <i>extremely relevant</i>).</span></p></li><li><p><span class="sentence"><i>Pleasantness</i>. “In this task, we are going to show you a list of words, and we would like you to rate the pleasantness of each word. </span><span class="sentence">Some of the words may be pleasant and others may not—it's up to you to decide.” </span><span class="sentence">The rating scale ranged from 1 ( <i>totally unpleasant</i>) to 5 ( <i>extremely pleasant</i>).</span></p></li><li><p><span class="sentence"><i>Imagery</i>. “In this experiment, we would like you to rate a list of words as to the ease or difficulty with which they arouse mental images. </span><span class="sentence">Nouns differ in their capacity to arouse mental images of things or events. </span><span class="sentence">Some words arouse a sensory experience, such as a mental picture or sound, very quickly and easily, whereas others may do so only with difficulty (i.e., after a long delay) or not at all. </span><span class="sentence">Any word which, in your estimation, arouses a mental image (i.e., a mental picture, or sound, or other sensory experience) very quickly and easily should be given a high imagery rating; a word that arouses a mental image with difficulty or not at all should be given a low imagery rating.” </span><span class="sentence">Rating values ranged from 1 ( <i>low imagery</i>) to 5 ( <i>high imagery</i>).</span></p></li><li><p><span class="sentence"><i>Self-reference</i>. “In this task, we would like you to think of personal experiences you have had in your life. </span><span class="sentence">We will present you with a series of words, and for each word we would like you to rate how easily the word brings to mind an important personal experience.” </span><span class="sentence">The rating scale ranged from 1 ( <i>very difficult</i>) to 5 ( <i>extremely easy</i>).</span></p></li><li><p><span class="sentence"><i>Generation</i>. “In this task, we are going to show you a list of words, and we would like you to rate the pleasantness of each word. </span><span class="sentence">Some of the words may be pleasant and others may not—it's up to you to decide. </span><span class="sentence">You will notice that the first two letters of each word are switched; before you make each rating, you will need to mentally switch the letters back to their original positions in order to know which word you are rating. </span><span class="sentence">For example, if you are presented with “iktten,” you will need to switch the first two letters in your head to get the word “kitten” and then you can make your pleasantness rating for that word.” </span><span class="sentence">Again, the rating scale ranged from 1 ( <i>totally unpleasant</i>) to 5 ( <i>extremely pleasant</i>).</span></p></li><li><p><span class="sentence"><i>Intentional learning</i>. “In this task, we are going to show you a list of words, and we would like you to try to remember those words for a future memory test.”</span></p></li></ul><p><span class="sentence">Words were displayed one at a time in the center of the computer screen. </span><span class="sentence">Each word appeared for 5 s along with the corresponding rating scale (presented just below the word). </span><span class="sentence">On each trial, the participant indicated his or her rating by clicking on the number that corresponded to his or her choice. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were advised to make their decisions quickly, given the 5-s presentation rate, and to try to use the entire rating scale (i.e., all the values from 1 to 5). </span><span class="sentence">A short practice period, during which participants rated 5 practice words, preceded the presentation of the 30 experimental stimuli.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Immediately following the rating task, participants were asked to recall digit strings for 2 min. </span><span class="sentence">In each trial of this task, seven single digits (ranging from 1 to 9) were presented one at a time, at a rate of one digit per second, and then participants were instructed to recall the digits in order by typing responses directly on the keyboard. </span><span class="sentence">The digit recall task was followed immediately by the recall test for the experimental words. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to write down the words they had rated earlier, in any order, on a response sheet provided by the experimenter. </span><span class="sentence">The final recall phase lasted 10 min.</span></p>
