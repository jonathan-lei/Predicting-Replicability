<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Study 4: Charitable Fundraising</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We conducted this field experiment with the cooperation of the South Korean office of Compassion International. </span><span class="sentence">For research purposes, we created a campaign that established a special fund to support AIDS orphans. </span><span class="sentence">The solicited population included people who provided their contact information but have not yet contributed to Compassion (i.e., the cold list) and regular donors, who donated an average of $32 per month over the past year (i.e., the hot list). </span><span class="sentence">They all learned that the campaign goal was to raise 10 million won (US$10,000) to help AIDS orphans in Africa and that approximately half the money had already been raised through various channels. </span><span class="sentence">Half the participants received a solicitation letter that emphasized how much had been donated (a to-date frame), and the other half received a letter that emphasized how much was still required to achieve the campaign goal (a to-go frame). </span><span class="sentence">We predicted that among potential donors from the cold list (uncertain commitment), an emphasis on what has been accomplished would increase donations, whereas among regular donors from the hot list (certain commitment), an emphasis on what has yet to be accomplished to achieve the goal would increase donations.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We included in the study 122 potential donors (58 men, 64 women), who constituted the entire cold list of Compassion Korea, and randomly sampled 124 regular donors (54 men, 70 women) from the hot list (more than 3000 donors). </span><span class="sentence">The participants were all from Korea. </span><span class="sentence">Their average age was 39 years old (cold list, <em>M</em> = 40 years; hot list, <em>M</em> = 37 years), and their ages ranged from 18 years old to 69 years old. </span><span class="sentence">Participants on the cold list were people who indicated interest in Compassion and who provided their names and addresses but who had not yet made a single donation. </span><span class="sentence">The average donation period for regular donors was 469 days ( <em>SD</em> = 147 days) before the beginning of the study.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This study had a 2 (commitment: cold list vs. hot list) × 2 (focus: to date vs. to go) between-subjects design. </span><span class="sentence">Participants received a solicitation letter from Compassion Korea (see http://www.compassion.or.kr) that invited them to support Compassion’s AIDS Initiative. </span><span class="sentence">Compassion is an international Christian child sponsorship organization (see http://www.compassion.com) with offices in nine countries. </span><span class="sentence">Since 1952, Compassion has provided support for children in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. </span><span class="sentence">Most regular donors provide a monthly gift that supports a child (or children) in one of these countries. </span><span class="sentence">Recently, Compassion has established the AIDS Initiative, which solicits gifts for food, shelter, medicine, and basic care for AIDS orphans.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">As part of our study, Compassion Korea joined the AIDS Initiative by sending a solicitation letter to potential donors (cold list) and regular donors (hot list). </span><span class="sentence">The letter described the organization and the AIDS Initiative. </span><span class="sentence">It indicated the following (translated from Korean):</span></p><blockquote><span class="sentence">Every 14 seconds, somewhere in this world, a child is orphaned by the AIDS virus. </span><span class="sentence">Every day, 14,000 children are infected by HIV and every year 510,000 children die due to AIDS. </span><span class="sentence">It is expected that by 2010, 2.5 million children will become orphans due to AIDS. </span><span class="sentence">These statistics do not even begin to depict the magnitude of the suffering that AIDS orphans are enduring. </span><span class="sentence">Subsequent to the parents’ death, AIDS orphans are ostracized by relatives and neighbors because of unfounded fears of contracting the disease. </span><span class="sentence">Shunned by the community and with no one to look after them, AIDS orphans cannot help but feel abandoned by the world around them and by God. </span><span class="sentence">Compassion Korea hopes to provide hope and dreams to these children who suffer under not only the weight of poverty but also AIDS. </span><span class="sentence">Help us provide shelter and solace to these children who have become exposed to this terrifying pandemic.</span></blockquote> The solicitation letter further indicated that<blockquote><span class="sentence">Compassion Korea’s special HIV/AIDS fund will provide children with food, blankets, clothes, and shelter through a special program tailored especially to their needs. </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, the fund will help provide badly needed medicine and treatment to families afflicted with AIDS and will provide educational and spiritual support for those most in need of a helping hand.</span></blockquote><span class="sentence"> Finally, the letter indicated that the goal of Compassion Korea was to raise 10 million won (approximately US$10,000) to help AIDS orphans in Africa.</span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The content of the solicitation letter was similar across conditions, except for the information about goal progress. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in the to-date condition read, “To this point, we have successfully raised $4,920 through various channels.” </span><span class="sentence">Those in the to-go condition read, “We have successfully raised money through various channels and need another $5,080.” </span><span class="sentence">As in previous studies, we included a chart describing the campaign goal and the current level of progress, which focused participants’ attention on to-date versus to-go information (see Figure 6). </span><span class="sentence">The chart included a long bar representing the campaign goal and, on top of it, an arrow representing the current level of progress. </span><span class="sentence">In the to-date condition, the top arrow began at the starting point on the left and ended at the current level of progress (50%). </span><span class="sentence">In the to-go condition, the top arrow began at the current level of progress (50%) and ended at the end point on the right ($10,000). </span><span class="sentence">We listed the campaign’s goal ($10,000) in the bars and listed the current level of progress or remaining progress in the arrows ($5,080 vs. $4,920).</span><br/><br/> <span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/psp-94-2-183-fig6a.gif"

Compassion solicitation letter figures (Study 4).</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The last part of the letter invited participants to provide their donations. </span><span class="sentence">Participants delivered their gifts directly to Compassion Korea’s account. </span><span class="sentence">The letter was sent in February 2006, and donations were received until May 2006. </span><span class="sentence">Compassion delivered the donations to support HIV/AIDS orphans in Uganda.</span></p>
