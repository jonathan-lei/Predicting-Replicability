<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">THE PRESENT RESEARCH</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">In the present experiment, we sought to provide evidence for a causal relation between blood glucose and effortful (System 2) decision processes. </span><span class="sentence">To do this, we applied the resource-depletion and glucose-snack manipulations to participants who then confronted the attraction problem. </span><span class="sentence">We sought, first, to replicate the attraction effect (Huber et al., 1982), in which the presence of a decoy option (that hardly anyone would actually choose) sways preferences between the other two options. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, we sought to replicate the finding that ego depletion, caused by prior exertion of self-control on a seemingly irrelevant task, intensifies the attraction effect (cf. Pocheptsova et al., 2007). </span><span class="sentence">To manipulate depletion, we adapted a procedure originally developed by Gilbert, Krull, and Pelham (1988). </span><span class="sentence">In this procedure, participants watch a silent video depicting a woman talking while a series of words flashes on the screen. </span><span class="sentence">In one condition, participants are instructed to avoid looking at the words, and if they do find themselves looking at the words, they are to bring their attention immediately back to focus on the woman. </span><span class="sentence">This task requires the deliberate control of attention and therefore should deplete the limited resources (i.e., willpower and glucose) needed for self-control and other System 2 activities. </span><span class="sentence">Other participants watch the same video without any special instructions.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">The prime goal of this work was to test our novel hypothesis that blood glucose reduces the attraction effect and restores effortful decision making. </span><span class="sentence">To do this, we adapted the glucose manipulation used by Gailliot et al. (2007). </span><span class="sentence">All participants drank a glass of lemonade, which by random assignment had been sweetened with either sugar or Splenda. </span><span class="sentence">The latter is a sugar substitute that tastes like real sugar (especially in lemonade). </span><span class="sentence">For present purposes, the key is that Splenda does not contribute anything to blood glucose. </span><span class="sentence">To the extent that effortful choice requires blood glucose, Splenda should not restore the necessary resources for effortful thought as effectively as sugar does.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Our main prediction was therefore that the attraction effect would be stronger among depleted participants (i.e., those who had performed a previous task requiring self-control) who drank lemonade made with Splenda. </span><span class="sentence">We reasoned that their blood glucose levels would have been reduced by the prior act of self-control, and that lemonade made with Splenda would be useless for raising those levels back to normal. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast, we predicted that participants who were depleted but then consumed sugar would be restored to a normal level of blood glucose and therefore would be less prone to rely on the heuristic, low-effort decision-making style.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">We also included conditions in which nondepleted participants drank either kind of lemonade. </span><span class="sentence">Our prediction was that when blood glucose was already at a normal level, there would be no benefit to be gained from consuming additional sugar, and so the type of lemonade would make no difference. </span><span class="sentence">These participants would show at best a weak attraction effect. </span><span class="sentence">But if the type of lemonade had some effect on decision making other than by counteracting depletion, we would be able to find that effect by examining the choices made by these nondepleted participants.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Method</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>Participants</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">One hundred twenty-one participants took part in the experiment in exchange for partial credit in their psychology course. </span><span class="sentence">Data from 1 participant were lost because of computer problems.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Procedure</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants had been told that the study dealt with two separate issues, namely, food preferences and impression formation. </span><span class="sentence">They were told they would first drink and rate a beverage and then form an impression of someone by watching a video.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">After giving informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to receive a lemonade beverage that had been sweetened with either sugar (glucose condition) or Splenda (placebo condition). </span><span class="sentence">The lemonade was administered first because it takes time (10â€“12 min) for glucose to be absorbed into the bloodstream. </span><span class="sentence">Neither the experimenter nor the participant was aware of which sweetener had been used. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter then left the room while participants rated the drink for quality of taste, pleasantness, and how difficult it was to drink. </span><span class="sentence">A 4-min period was allocated for these ratings (partly to allow time for the glucose to be metabolized). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to sit quietly after completing the ratings and to await the experimenter's return.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">After 4 min, the experimenter returned and gave participants instructions for the impression-formation task. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told that they would watch a 6-min video (without sound) of a woman being interviewed by an off-camera interviewer. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter said that the research was aimed at elucidating how people interpret nonverbal behaviors. </span><span class="sentence">As the woman was interviewed, the video displayed a series of common words (e.g., <i>shoe</i>) for 10 s each. </span><span class="sentence">These words appeared in black text in a white box in the lower portion of the screen. </span><span class="sentence">By random assignment, half the participants were instructed not to read or look at any of the words (depletion condition). </span><span class="sentence">If they caught themselves looking at the words, they were supposed to redirect their gaze immediately to the woman. </span><span class="sentence">The other half of the participants were given no such instructions (no-depletion condition).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">After participants watched the video, they completed the Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS; Mayer &amp; Gaschke, 1988). </span><span class="sentence">The combination of the 4-min lemonade manipulation, the 6-min video, and the BMIS ensured that more than 10 min had elapsed since participants drank the lemonade, so we assumed that by the time they completed the BMIS, the sugar was metabolized and was therefore becoming available as glucose in the bloodstream. </span><span class="sentence">Hence, at this point, we administered the primary dependent measure.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Participants were told that the procedure required some time to pass before they rated their impression of the woman in the video. </span><span class="sentence">In the meantime, they were asked to pretest a consumer decision task for another study. </span><span class="sentence">This task was taken from research by Pocheptsova et al. (2007). </span><span class="sentence">Instructions printed on a sheet of paper told participants to imagine that they were searching for a new apartment for the coming school year. </span><span class="sentence">They were to choose among three options. </span><span class="sentence">All participants saw the main options B and C, plus one of two decoys, A or D. Table 1 shows all four options. </span><span class="sentence">Decoy A resembles B but is inferior to it on both dimensions, whereas decoy D resembles C and is inferior on both dimensions.</span></p><div class="NLM_table-wrap"><div class="caption"><p><span class="captionLabel">TABLE 1</span> <i>Choice Frequencies in Each Condition</i></p></div><img src="/paper_data/img/10.1111_j.1467-9280.2008.02077.x-table1.jpeg" alt="" id="_i8"/></div><p><span class="sentence">After the decision task, the experimenter explained that the participants would not be rating their impressions of the woman in the video. </span><span class="sentence">Instead, participants were debriefed regarding the true nature of the study. </span><span class="sentence">They were thanked for their participation, awarded partial course credit, and dismissed from the lab.</span></p>
