<span class="sentence">      The flow of activation from concepts to phonological forms within the word production system was examined in 3 experiments. </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 1, participants named pictures while ignoring superimposed distractor pictures that were semantically related, phonologically related, or unrelated. </span><span class="sentence">Eye movements and naming latencies were recorded. </span><span class="sentence">The distractor pictures affected the latencies of gaze shifting and vocal naming. </span><span class="sentence">The magnitude of the phonological effects increased linearly with latency, excluding lapses of attention as the cause of the effects. </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 2, no distractor effects were obtained when both pictures were named. </span><span class="sentence">When pictures with superimposed distractor words were named or the words were read in Experiment 3, the words influenced the latencies of gaze shifting and picture naming, but the pictures yielded no such latency effects in word reading. </span><span class="sentence">The picture-word asymmetry was obtained even with equivalent reading and naming latencies. </span><span class="sentence">The picture-picture effects suggest that activation spreads continuously from concepts to phonological forms, whereas the picture-word asymmetry indicates that the amount of activation is limited and task dependent.</span>
