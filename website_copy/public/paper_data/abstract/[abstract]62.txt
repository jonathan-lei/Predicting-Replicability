<span class="sentence">      In 2 experiments participants named pictures of common objects with superimposed distractor words. </span><span class="sentence">In one naming condition, the pictures and words were presented simultaneously on every trial, and participants produced the target response immediately. </span><span class="sentence">In the other naming condition, the presentation of the picture preceded the presentation of the distractor by 1,000 ms, and participants delayed production of their naming response until distractor word presentation. </span><span class="sentence">Within each naming condition, the distractor words were either semantic category coordinates of the target pictures or unrelated. </span><span class="sentence">Orthogonal to this manipulation of semantic relatedness, the frequency of the pictures' names was manipulated. </span><span class="sentence">The authors observed semantic interference effects in both the immediate and delayed naming conditions but a frequency effect only in the immediate naming condition. </span><span class="sentence">These data indicate that semantic interference can be observed when target picture naming latencies do not reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection. </span><span class="sentence">In the context of other findings from the picture-word interference paradigm, the authors interpret these data as supporting the view that the semantic interference effect arises at a postlexical level of processing.</span>
