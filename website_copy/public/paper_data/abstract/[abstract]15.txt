<span class="sentence">      The authors investigated semantic neighborhood density effects on visual word processing to examine the dynamics of activation and competition among semantic representations. </span><span class="sentence">Experiment 1 validated feature-based semantic representations as a basis for computing semantic neighborhood density and suggested that near and distant neighbors have opposite effects on word processing. </span><span class="sentence">Experiment 2 confirmed these results: Word processing was slower for dense near neighborhoods and faster for dense distant neighborhoods. </span><span class="sentence">Analysis of a computational model showed that attractor dynamics can produce this pattern of neighborhood effects. </span><span class="sentence">The authors argue for reconsideration of traditional models of neighborhood effects in terms of attractor dynamics, which allow both inhibitory and facilitative effects to emerge.</span>
