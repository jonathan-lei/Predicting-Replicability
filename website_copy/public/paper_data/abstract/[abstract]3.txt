<span class="sentence">A photograph of an action can convey a vivid sense of motion. </span><span class="sentence">Does the inference of motion from viewing a photograph involve the same neural and psychological representations used when one views physical motion? </span><span class="sentence">In this study, we tested whether implied motion is represented by the same direction-selective signals involved in the perception of real motion. </span><span class="sentence">We made use of the motion aftereffect, a visual motion illusion. </span><span class="sentence">Three experiments showed that viewing a series of static photographs with implied motion in a particular direction produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction, as assessed with real-motion test probes. </span><span class="sentence">The transfer of adaptation from motion depicted in photographs to real motion demonstrates that the perception of implied motion activates direction-selective circuits that are also involved in processing real motion.</span>
