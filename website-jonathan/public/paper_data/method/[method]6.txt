<h3>Experiment 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In Experiment 2, we corroborated the results of Experiment 1 by using the same–different task with numbers in Arabic and Indian notations. </span><span class="sentence">As mentioned earlier, a CDE was found in the physical same–different task of Dehaene and Akhavein (1995) only for same-notation pairs and not for different-notation pairs. </span><span class="sentence">As acknowledged by the authors, the absence of a CDE for the latter might be explained at least in part by the fact that an Arabic number and a number word are highly dissimilar perceptually, and this enabled participants to respond quickly to the task, leaving little opportunity for the irrelevant numerical value to affect performance. </span><span class="sentence">The use of two sets of numerical symbols in Experiment 2 was expected to make the physical same–different task harder and to enable exploring the presence of a CDE under less speeded conditions.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">It should be noted that the same–different and the comparisons tasks, although similar, each provide a unique piece of information, as the latter provides information on the numbers cardinality, whereas the former provides information about the numbers ordinality.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">There was a procedural difference between these tasks. </span><span class="sentence">In the former, the stimuli were presented on the screen until the participant's response, whereas in latter task, used by Dehaene and Akhavein (1995), the stimuli were presented for 200 ms. To test the effect of exposure duration, we presented the number pairs on the screen for 200 ms for half of the participants in Experiment 2, whereas for the other half, we presented the numbers pairs on the screen until the participant's response. </span><span class="sentence">All participants performed both the numerical and the physical same–different tasks.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Thirty-two students of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel) or Achva Academic College (Israel) participated in the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">All of them were native speakers of Arabic who studied in a Hebrew-speaking academic institute. </span><span class="sentence">They participated either for course credits or payment.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The stimuli set was created following the method of Experiments 1 and 2 of Dehaene and Akhavein (1995). </span><span class="sentence">The 12 experimental pairs were composed of the Digits 1, 2, 8, and 9. </span><span class="sentence">There were three categories of numerical difference in this set: pairs with zero numerical difference (11, 22, 88, 99), pairs with a numerical difference of 1 (12, 21, 89, 98), and pairs with a numerical difference of 6 and larger (18, 19, 28, 29, 81, 91, 82, 92). </span><span class="sentence">In the numerical same–different task, to equalize the frequency of trials from each difference category, the pairs with the numerical difference of 0 were presented four times each, the pairs with the numerical difference of 1 were presented four times each, and the pairs with the large numerical difference were presented twice each, thus creating a block of 48 trials. </span><span class="sentence">Each number was about 13 mm high and 9 mm wide. </span><span class="sentence">The distance between the centers of the digits was 6.5 mm. Each number in each pair could be presented in either Arabic or Indian notation. </span><span class="sentence">There were thus three notations: Arabic, Indian, and Mixed notations (including both Arabic–Indian and Indian–Arabic pairs), creating an experimental set of 48 × 4 = 192 trials. </span><span class="sentence">Following Dehaene and Akhavein, to prevent participants from focusing exclusively on the Numbers 1, 2, 8, and 9, we added 72 distracting trials using the Digits 3–7. </span><span class="sentence">The distracting trials were not analyzed. </span><span class="sentence">Please note that the frequency of “same” responses in the numerical same–different task was 33% in the experimental set, but it was 48% in the whole set (including the fillers).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the physical same–different task, the four pairs with a numerical distance of 0 in both the Arabic and Indian notations appeared eight times because of a programming error instead of four times as in the numerical comparison task. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, the experimental set included 224 instead of 192 trials, with 29% being “same” responses. </span><span class="sentence">With the additional 106 filler trials, the frequency of “same” responses was 40%. </span><span class="sentence">In any case, the critical comparison was always within the “different” trials, thus making the difference in the percentage of “same” and “different” responses less important.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The apparatus was identical to that of Experiment 1.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment was conducted individually. </span><span class="sentence">Each participant performed both the numerical and the physical same–different tasks, with the order of tasks counterbalanced across participants. </span><span class="sentence">The participant sat about 50 cm from the computer screen. </span><span class="sentence">The trial started with a fixation cross that appeared at the center of the screen for 500 ms.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the numerical same–different task, participants were instructed to decide whether the two numbers were the same in terms of their values, irrespective of notations. </span><span class="sentence">In the physical same–different task, participants were instructed to decide whether the two numbers were physically identical. </span><span class="sentence">In both tasks, they had to press the “A” key for a “same” response and the “L” key for a “different” response. </span><span class="sentence">A few examples of same-notation and different-notation pairs were presented following the instructions for each task along with the correct responses. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were required to respond as fast as possible but to avoid errors. </span><span class="sentence">There was a short rest break between the two tasks as well as after each sequence of 112 trials. </span><span class="sentence">For 16 participants, the numbers in both tasks were flashed for 200 ms, and for the rest, they remained on the screen until the participant's response.</span></p>
