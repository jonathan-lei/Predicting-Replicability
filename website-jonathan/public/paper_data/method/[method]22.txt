<h3>Method</h3><br/> <h4>Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Twenty-four adults from the Université Laval, Québec City, Québec, Canada, took part in the experiment in exchange for a small honorarium. </span><span class="sentence">All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal audition and vision.</span></p> <h4>Material</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The ISR task was programmed with Microsoft Visual Basic (Version 6.0). </span><span class="sentence">At each trial, nine letters were played to the participant through headphones at a rate of one letter per second (700 ms On, 300 ms Off) at approximately 65 dB(A). </span><span class="sentence">The items were recorded in a French female voice and edited with Sound Forge (Version 7.0; Sony Corporation, 2003). </span><span class="sentence">The same set of monosyllabic letters was used over trials (<em>D</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>, <em>K</em>, <em>L</em>, <em>N</em>, <em>Q</em>, and <em>R</em>); only the order of presentation changed from trial to trial. </span><span class="sentence">After each sequence, the nine letters were randomly presented horizontally within a 17- × 17-cm frame on a computer screen, and participants had to give their responses by using a mouse to click on the letters. </span><span class="sentence">Each letter changed from black to green when selected and remained that way until the end of the trial.</span></p> <h4>Design and Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The sequence heard on Trial 4 was presented 12 times during the experiment, once every four trials. </span><span class="sentence">There were three novel randomly generated sequences between each repetition of the critical sequence, forming 12 blocks of four trials. </span><span class="sentence">Two practice trials preceded the 48 experimental trials (12 repeated sequences and 36 novel sequences). </span><span class="sentence">The critical repeated sequence was randomly chosen for each participant. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told to memorize all the items they heard in the same order in which they were presented and to try to reproduce the correct sequence in the recall phase. </span><span class="sentence">Participants received no feedback on their responses. </span><span class="sentence">No other instructions were given and, of course, no cues about the repeating sequences were provided. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were tested individually.</span></p> <h3>Results and Discussion</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">To study the classical Hebb repetition effect, the proportion of correct responses for repeated and novel sequences was calculated for each of the 12 experimental blocks. </span><span class="sentence">All items recalled in their correct serial position were considered correct. </span><span class="sentence">We calculated slopes for the proportion of correct responses across for repeated and nonrepeated sequences (separately for each participant and then averaged over all 24 participants). </span><span class="sentence">Two average learning slopes are compared. </span><span class="sentence">One slope represents the change in proportion of correct responses on Presentations 1 to 12 of the repeated sequence. </span><span class="sentence">The second slope corresponds to the change in proportion of correct responses for the 12 corresponding blocks of three nonrepeated trials. </span><span class="sentence">We observed a Hebb repetition effect, that is, a sequence repetition learning beyond mere task practice. </span><span class="sentence">Indeed, the averaged learning slope for the repeated series was 0.15 correct items per repetition and 0.05 correct items for the novel trials. </span><span class="sentence">This difference was significant, <em>t</em>(23) = 1.99, <em>p</em> = .05, effect size <em>d</em> = 0.83.</span></p> <h4>New Errors Versus Repeated Errors</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Responses not recalled in their proper serial positions were classified as erroneous responses. </span><span class="sentence">The error analysis was restricted to the 11 last-repeated trials (errors on the first presentation of the critical list are necessarily new). </span><span class="sentence">If a given error was previously made in the same serial position on any preceding repeated sequence, it was counted as a repeated error. </span><span class="sentence">Otherwise, the error counted as a new error. </span><span class="sentence">Figure 1 shows the number of correct responses and errors made by participants for the repeated series in the verbal ISR task. </span><span class="sentence">On this diagram, errors are decomposed into new and repeated errors. </span><span class="sentence">Repeated errors were further decomposed into repetitions from the last repeated sequence (<em>n</em> − 1) or repetitions from an earlier sequence (<em>n</em> − 2+). </span><span class="sentence">Estes (1991) showed that protrusions from the sequence that immediately precedes a list are a key source of error. </span><span class="sentence">Figure 1 suggests that protrusions may also originate from preceding <em>repeated sequences</em> when using a Hebb paradigm (interspaced by filler lists). </span><span class="sentence">These two types of protrusions are conceptually distinct and complementary. </span><span class="sentence">Only protrusions from the repeated sequences are considered in the present study to test whether these errors are subject to a form of learning that mirrors the classical Hebb repetition effect.</span><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-3-524-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-3-524-fig1a.gif"/><em>Figure 1. Diagram screening types of responses made to the 11 repetitions of the recurring sequence. Totals are calculated for all participants combined.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">When one uses the Hebb procedure, two forms of learning may occur across the repeated sequences: One is characterized by an increasing proportion of correct responses, and one is characterized by an increasing proportion of repeated errors. </span><span class="sentence">The former corresponds to the classical Hebb sequence learning effect, whereas the latter suggests that learning can also take place for erroneous responses. </span><span class="sentence">However, one has to consider that simply repeating errors does not necessarily indicate that they are learned. </span><span class="sentence">Indeed, fixed error probabilities (with no learning across repetitions) can also explain why errors are repeated. </span><span class="sentence">Repeated errors can be shown to increase simply due to chance, given constant error probabilities. </span><span class="sentence"> This increase in recurring errors across the 12 experimental blocks is attributable to the fact that each new error necessarily increases the probability for subsequent errors to be classified as <em>repeated</em> rather than <em>new</em>. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, a simple error repetition analysis does not adequately answer the question of interest.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">If errors are progressively learned across repetitions of the critical sequence as typically observed for correct responses, then they should become more probable as a function of the number of times that they have been produced in previous identical sequences. </span><span class="sentence">On the basis of this reasoning, we developed a measure that can reveal two sides of Hebbian learning. </span><span class="sentence">Indeed this measure applies both to correct responses and errors. </span><span class="sentence">The measure and analysis are proved valid by simulation (i.e., that they do not falsely indicate error learning when there is none).</span></p> <h4>A Measure of Response Learning Across Repeated Sequences</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We hypothesize that if learning takes place on the basis of responses made (correct or incorrect), then the probability of producing a given response should increase as a function of the number of times the same response had previously been recalled (referred to as the number of past occurrences). </span><span class="sentence">The number of past occurrences indicates the specific number of times that a response is produced at the same serial position in preceding presentations of the repeated sequence. </span><span class="sentence">The key difference between error learning across repeated sequences and error repetitions due to constant transposition probabilities is that the latter does not predict an increase in error probabilities across the number of past occurrences. </span><span class="sentence">Conversely, if a response (correct or incorrect) is repeated without being learned—as tested in a simulation reported below—its observed probability should be invariable across those repetitions.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Probabilities were calculated for the nine correct responses (one for each serial position) and for 16 transposition errors involving the most common errors in ISR, that is, Serial Position <em>p</em> − 1 or <em>p</em> + 1 transpositions. </span><span class="sentence">Each of the nine serial positions was associated with two types of transpositions, <em>p</em> − 1 or <em>p</em> + 1, except for the first and the final serial positions for which only one transposition can occur, <em>p</em> + 1 for the first serial position or <em>p</em> − 1 for the final one. </span><span class="sentence">The transpositions considered in the current analysis were as follows: <em>T</em>1 + 1, <em>T</em>2 − 1, <em>T</em>2 + 1, <em>T</em>3 − 1, <em>T</em>3 + 1, <em>T</em>4 − 1, <em>T</em>4 + 1, <em>T</em>5 − 1, <em>T</em>5 + 1, <em>T</em>6 − 1, <em>T</em>6 + 1, <em>T</em>7 − 1, <em>T</em>7 + 1, <em>T</em>8 − 1, <em>T</em>8 + 1, <em>T</em>9 − 1. </span><span class="sentence">For instance, a <em>T</em>2 + 1 transposition involves an incorrect item recalled on Serial Position 2 that should have been recalled on Serial Position 3. </span><span class="sentence">It is worth noting that errors studied here are perhaps those that are the most likely to be learned. </span><span class="sentence">Other transpositions (of Serial Position <em>p</em> + 3 or <em>p</em> − 3, for example) may show a weaker learning effect (or interfere less with the production of a correct response).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">For correct responses, probabilities were computed separately for each serial position. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, data from responses with different probabilities were not aggregated. </span><span class="sentence">The analysis involves sorting responses according to the number of occurrences of that response in the preceding trials of the repeated sequence. </span><span class="sentence">Each time a response is recalled by a participant (at the relevant serial position), it counts as an occurrence of that response for a specific repetition (Repetition 1, Repetition 2, and so on). </span><span class="sentence">For each repetition, probabilities are calculated by counting the number of occurrences of a response and dividing it by the number of opportunities. </span><span class="sentence">Response opportunities correspond to the number of presentations of the repeated sequence (those associated with a same number of past occurrences) in which the response was produced or could have been produced. </span><span class="sentence">The occurrences and opportunities for each number of past occurrences are pooled across participants before the probability of each response is computed. </span><span class="sentence">Table 1 shows the responses of a sample participant for the 12 repetitions of the critical sequence. </span><span class="sentence">These data will be used as an example to show exactly how response probabilities are calculated for each repetition.</span><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip"

Occurrences for Correct Response Q at Position 3 and Transposition Error K at Position 8</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The present analysis requires calculating the probability of a response for each repetition of that response. </span><span class="sentence">For each cell in Table 1, the number of past occurrences can be obtained by counting the number of previous occurrences of the target response in the cells above it in the same column. </span><span class="sentence">Table 1 shows two examples of this procedure, one for a correct response (Q at Position 3) and the other for a transposition error (K at Position 8). </span><span class="sentence">These examples (described below) were chosen randomly from our sample of participants for illustrative purposes.</span></p> <h4>Example 1</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The first example shows how to calculate the probability of producing the correct response “Q” at Serial Position 3 as a function of the number of previous occurrences of that response. </span><span class="sentence">At the first presentation of the list, the number of prior occurrences of that Response Q is 0 (see Column Q in Table 1). </span><span class="sentence">In this example, the number of prior occurrences becomes 1 at the second presentation of the repeated sequence because there is now 1 occurrence of Response Q above that cell. </span><span class="sentence">This value does not change at the third presentation because there is still only 1 prior occurrence of Response “Q” (the occurrence of “Q” at the third presentation does not count as a prior occurrence). </span><span class="sentence">The number of prior occurrences becomes 2 at the fourth presentation, 3 at the seventh presentation, 4 at the eighth presentation, and so on. The number of occurrences and opportunities of a response are calculated for Repetitions 1 to 4. </span><span class="sentence">There is 1 occurrence of Response Q among the two cells that have 1 prior occurrence of that response (those at the second and third presentations of the repeated sequence; see Column Q in Table 1). </span><span class="sentence">For that participant, we count 1 occurrence and 2 opportunities for producing that response at Repetition 1. </span><span class="sentence">For Repetition 2, there were 3 opportunities (the fourth, fifth, and sixth presentations) and again only 1 occurrence. </span><span class="sentence">Hence, for Repetition 1 the probability of producing the correct response is 1/2. </span><span class="sentence">For Repetition 2, the probability is 1/3. </span><span class="sentence">Using the same logic, for Repetition 3 the probability is 1/1, and for Repetition 4, the observed probability is 1/1. </span><span class="sentence">The number of occurrences is always either 0 or 1 when based on individual participant data (after a single occurrence, if there is one, the number of prior occurrences necessarily increases). </span><span class="sentence">To obtain group trends, occurrences and opportunities are pooled across participants for each number of prior occurrences. </span><span class="sentence">For example, across all participants, the probability of producing the correct response at Serial Position 3 when there is 1 prior occurrence (Repetition 1) is obtained by dividing the total of 24 occurrences by the total of 51 opportunities, giving a probability of .47. </span><span class="sentence">For Repetition 4, the total across participants is 21 occurrences on 26 opportunities, giving a probability of .81. </span><span class="sentence">This means that when this item has been recalled four times in previous repeated lists, the observed probability of recalling it again on the next repeated list is .81. </span><span class="sentence">For the present analysis, we only estimated the probabilities for Repetitions 1, 2, 3, and 4. </span><span class="sentence">The trend for each response was then approximated with a slope.</span></p> <h4>Example 2</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The same procedure was used for each of the 16 errors selected for the present analysis (<em>p</em> − 1 or <em>p</em> + 1 transpositions). </span><span class="sentence">Example 2 shows how to calculate the probability of producing the error “K” at Serial Position 8 (Transposition <em>T</em>8 − 1) as a function of the number of previous occurrences of that response. </span><span class="sentence">In Table 1 (Column F), the number of prior occurrences displayed corresponds to the error K, not to the correct response. </span><span class="sentence">The number of prior occurrences in each cell is calculated by counting the number of Ks in the cells above it (i.e., in the previous presentations of the repeated sequence). </span><span class="sentence">The error K occurred once when the number of prior occurrences was 1 (Repetition 1) and there was only 1 opportunity. </span><span class="sentence">For Repetition 2, there was 1 occurrence on 4 opportunities. </span><span class="sentence">Repetition 3 has 1 occurrence of Error K and 3 opportunities. </span><span class="sentence">For Repetition 4, there was 1 occurrence and 1 opportunity. </span><span class="sentence">To estimate response probabilities for each repetition, we divided the total number of occurrences on the total number of opportunities when combined for all 24 participants. </span><span class="sentence">For example, transposition <em>T</em>8 − 1 was actually produced 8 times out of 29 occasions for Repetition 2, when calculated over all participants (note that if all 24 participants had repeated that error twice, the total number of occurrences would have been 24). </span><span class="sentence">The estimated probability of transposition <em>T</em>8 − 1 for Repetition 2 was .28.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The probabilities for each correct response and transposition, as a function of the number of past occurrences, are listed in Table 2 and Table 3. </span><span class="sentence">For each response, we calculated the slope of the estimated probabilities for Repetitions 1 to 4. </span><span class="sentence">A positive slope suggests that learning occurred.</span><br/><br/> <img

1–4)</em></p> <h4>Simulation</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">To show that this measure is valid and not biased in any way, a simulation was designed to test a null model that assumes that there is no error learning, only correct repetition learning. </span><span class="sentence">For the error learning analysis, the simulation data can be viewed as a control group. </span><span class="sentence">The simulation also assumes that repetition learning relates specifically to the production of correct responses. </span><span class="sentence">It attempts to replicate the Hebb repetition effect by relying exclusively on a (correct) response-learning mechanism. </span><span class="sentence">The basic probabilities used to generate correct responses and errors (transpositions) are shown in Table 4. </span><span class="sentence">These probabilities were chosen arbitrarily for the purposes of (a) recreating a typical serial position effect and (b) reproducing a typical trend in error distributions where transposition probabilities diminish with the number of serial positions between the error and the correct response. </span><span class="sentence">To simulate correct response learning, a new set of probabilities was derived for each repetition of the correct response. </span><span class="sentence">At each repetition, its probability of being recalled was increased by 9% (which corresponds to the learning slope for correct responses in the experiment). </span><span class="sentence">The chance of recalling the other possible responses was reduced by that same percentage (this reduction was distributed evenly across responses). </span><span class="sentence">No additional parameters or assumptions were necessary for the simulation. </span><span class="sentence">The simulation generated data for 200 fictitious participants. </span><span class="sentence">Each simulated participant performed 12 repeated sequences (there was no point in simulating the filler lists because they were not part of the analysis). </span><span class="sentence">Individual differences were entirely due to random sampling, as the data were generated with the same underlying probabilities (those in Table 4). </span><span class="sentence">Error repetitions throughout the 12 trials were necessarily due to chance (not to error learning). </span><span class="sentence">This simulation thus embodies the null hypothesis that no error learning occurs but that errors are nevertheless repeated due to the usual pattern of transpositions. </span><span class="sentence">The simulated data can then be analyzed in exactly the same way as the empirical data. </span><span class="sentence">If the learning measure is sound, then response probabilities for the simulated errors should not increase as a function of the number of prior occurrences of these errors. </span><span class="sentence">However, the same measure should indicate that correct response probabilities increased across Repetitions 1 to 4, at a similar rate to that observed in the experiment (increasing by 9% at each repetition).</span><br/><br/>
