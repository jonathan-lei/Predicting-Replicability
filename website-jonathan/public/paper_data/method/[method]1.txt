<h3>Study 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The first study was designed to test the first part of our theoretical model: In the course of an offense, victims primarily experience an impairment to their psychological resource of power and consequently have a stronger need to restore power. </span><span class="sentence">By contrast, perpetrators primarily experience an impairment to their psychological resource of moral worth and hence have a higher need for social acceptance. </span><span class="sentence">Unlike past research on victim–perpetrator relations that has investigated this topic through the use of role-playing techniques (e.g., Foster &amp; Rusbult, 1999) or recall of relevant life situations (e.g., McCullough et al., 1997), we chose a laboratory setting to test our hypotheses. </span><span class="sentence">The use of the experimental method allowed us to randomly assign participants to the victim or perpetrator role in the same controlled social situation. </span><span class="sentence">This created two major methodological challenges: The first was to provide a cover story that was ethically sound, given that classical paradigms that produce victims and perpetrators such as the teacher–student paradigm (Milgram, 1974) or the jail paradigm (Haney, Banks, &amp; Zimbardo, 1973) are unacceptable. </span><span class="sentence">The second was to have all participants in the perpetrator condition hurt their victim and believe that they had done so of their own volition. </span><span class="sentence">The experimental design was a 2 × 2 between-subjects design: Role (victim vs. perpetrator) × Condition (experimental vs. control).</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants (<em>N</em> = 103) were 81 female and 22 male university undergraduates (age: <em>M</em> = 23 years), who were paid for their participation. </span><span class="sentence">Men and women were represented in equal proportion in the four experimental cells.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment was described as a study being conducted by the International Advertising Association (IAA) in collaboration with Tel Aviv University Business School. </span><span class="sentence">All instructions and procedures were computerized.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were told that they would take part in a “creativity test” meant to identify participants who had a high potential to work in the advertising industry. </span><span class="sentence">To enhance the value of success on the creativity test, participants were told that if they succeeded on the test they could advance to a second and rewarding phase of the study.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were then randomly assigned to be either “writers” or “judges.” </span><span class="sentence">The writers' task was to write slogans for a list of products that were presented to them, and the judges' task was to evaluate these slogans. </span><span class="sentence">To advance to the second phase of the study, writers had to achieve an average score of at least 85. </span><span class="sentence">Judges were told that their advancement to the second phase depended on an assessment by an IAA representative of the quality of their judgment and their ability to evaluate creativity potential. </span><span class="sentence">To maintain a high level of psychological relevance of the interaction with the partner, all participants were led to believe that after the test they would have to work together with their partner on a common task.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Judges in the experimental condition were advised to be strict in their evaluations and to judge the slogans by real-world standards, whereas judges in the control condition were advised to be lenient and regard the slogans as preliminary drafts. </span><span class="sentence">It was stressed that following this advice for lenient or strict assessments of the slogans would increase the judges' chances of passing to the next phase of the experiment, which was presented as highly rewarding. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, judges in both conditions were free to choose which grades to give their partners, but in the experimental condition they knew that being too nice to their partner might harm their chances of moving to the next and rewarding phase of the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">As a result of these instructions, judges in the experimental condition gave their partners lower grades, and the experimenter later informed them that the writers had failed the test due their harsh evaluations. </span><span class="sentence">Judges in the control condition gave their partners higher grades, and the experimenter later informed these judges that despite their positive evaluations, the IAA committee declined to advance the writer to the second phase due to external considerations. </span><span class="sentence">Writers in the experimental condition received low scores from their partners throughout the exam and consequently failed the test, whereas writers in the control condition received relatively higher scores from their partners but were informed that they failed the test due to the decision of the IAA representatives.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Afterward, the experimenter asked participants to complete questionnaires, which included the dependent measures. </span><span class="sentence">These were presented as a standard feedback procedure required by the university's ethics committee. </span><span class="sentence">Upon completion, participants were thanked and debriefed.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The questionnaire included (a) manipulation checks, (b) a measure of sense of power, (c) a measure of public moral image, and (d) measures of need for power and need for social acceptance.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Manipulation checks</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were asked to indicate on a 7-point scale the degree to which they (a) were offended by their partner, (b) felt that their partner had caused them injustice, (c) offended their partner, or (d) felt that they had caused their partner injustice. </span><span class="sentence">Ratings for the first two items were highly correlated (<em>r</em> = .85) and were averaged to obtain a single measure of victimhood. </span><span class="sentence">Ratings for the third and fourth items were also highly correlated (<em>r</em> = .86) and were averaged to obtain a single measure of perpetration.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Sense of power</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Three 7-point scale items measured participants' self-perception of power: (a) <em>During the interaction with my partner, I felt relatively weak</em> to <em>I felt relatively strong</em>; (b) <em>I did not have a lot of influence on the interaction with my partner</em> to <em>I had a lot of influence</em>; and (c) <em>I had the lower hand</em> to <em>I had the upper hand</em>. </span><span class="sentence">Another three items measured the public image of power (i.e., the extent to which participants thought their partners viewed them as powerful): <em>My partner perceives me as…</em> (a) <em>relatively weak</em> to <em>relatively strong</em>, (b) <em>not having a lot of control over the interaction between us</em> to <em>having a lot of control</em>, and (c) <em>having relatively low influence on the interaction</em> to <em>relatively high influence</em>. </span><span class="sentence">Ratings for the 6 items were averaged to obtain a single measure of sense of power (Cronbach's α = .92).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Public moral image</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Three 7-point scale items measured participants' public moral image (i.e., the extent to which participants believed that their partners viewed them as moral): <em>My partner perceives…</em> (a) <em>me as not being completely moral</em> to <em>me as being completely moral</em>, (b) <em>my behavior as not 100% appropriate</em> to <em>my behavior as 100% appropriate</em>, and (c) <em>my behavior as not ethically flawless</em> to <em>my behavior as ethically flawless</em>. </span><span class="sentence">Ratings for the three items were averaged to obtain a single measure of public moral image (Cronbach's α = .92).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Emotional needs</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Four 7-point scale items measured participants' need for power: <em>I would like to</em>… (a) <em>have more influence on the test and its procedure</em>, (b) <em>have more power in the role to which I was assigned</em>, (c) <em>increase my level of control over the interaction between myself and my partner</em>, and (d) <em>have more say during joint work</em>. </span><span class="sentence">Participants rated these items from 1 (<em>not particularly</em>) to 7 (<em>very much</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Ratings for the four items were averaged to obtain a single measure of need for power (Cronbach's α = .95).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Five 7-point scale items measured participants' need for social acceptance: <em>I would like…</em> (a) <em>to explain my considerations during the task to my partner</em>, (b) <em>my partner to understand the reasons for my behavior</em>, (c) <em>my partner to know that I tried to act fairly during the test</em>, (d) <em>my partner to know that I did not act out of thoughtlessness</em>, and (e) <em>my partner to understand that I am not a harsh person</em>. </span><span class="sentence">Ratings for the five items were averaged to obtain a single measure of need for social acceptance (Cronbach's α = .89). </span><span class="sentence">The dependent variables above were used in identical form in the subsequent studies, except for minor adjustments in wording that were made to suit the different experimental contexts.</span></p>
