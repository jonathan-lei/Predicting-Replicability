<span class="sentence">      In 5 experiments, results showed that when participants are faced with materials embedding relations between both adjacent and nonadjacent elements, they learn exclusively the type of relations they had to actively process in order to meet the task demands, irrespective of the spatial contiguity of the paired elements. </span><span class="sentence">These results are consonant with current theories positing that attention is a necessary condition for learning. </span><span class="sentence">More important, the results provide support for a more radical conception, in which the joint attentional processing of 2 events is also a sufficient condition for learning the relation between them. </span><span class="sentence">The well-documented effect of contiguity could be a by-product of the fact that attention generally focuses on contiguous events. </span><span class="sentence">This reappraisal considerably extends the scope of approaches based on associative or statistical processes.</span>
