<span class="sentence">Extremal edges (EEs) are projections of viewpoint-specific horizons of self-occlusion on smooth convex surfaces. </span><span class="sentence">An ecological analysis of viewpoint constraints suggests that an EE surface is likely to be closer to the observer than the non-EE surface on the other side of the edge. </span><span class="sentence">In two experiments, one using shading gradients and the other using texture gradients, we demonstrated that EEs operate as strong cues to relative depth perception and figure-ground organization. </span><span class="sentence">Image regions with an EE along the shared border were overwhelmingly perceived as closer than either flat or equally convex surfaces without an EE along that border. </span><span class="sentence">A further demonstration suggests that EEs are more powerful than classical figure-ground cues, including even the joint effects of small size, convexity, and surroundedness.</span>
