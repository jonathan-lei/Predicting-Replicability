<span class="sentence">      Results from 2 relational-priming experiments suggest the existence of an automatic analogical coordination between semantic and arithmetic relations. </span><span class="sentence">Word pairs denoting object sets served as primes in a task that elicits "obligatory" activation of addition facts (5 + 3 activates 8; J. LeFevre, J. Bisanz, &amp; L. Mrkonjic, 1988). </span><span class="sentence">Semantic relations between the priming words were either aligned or misaligned with the structure of addition (M. </span><span class="sentence">Bassok, V. M. Chase, &amp; S. A. Martin, 1998). </span><span class="sentence">Obligatory activation of addition facts occurred when the digits were primed by categorically related words (tulips-daisies), which are aligned with addition, but did not occur when the digits were primed by unrelated words (hens-radios, Experiment 1) or by functionally related words (records-songs, Experiment 2), which are misaligned with addition. </span><span class="sentence">These findings lend support to the viability of automatic analogical priming (B. </span><span class="sentence">A. </span><span class="sentence">Spellman, K.
