<span class="sentence">Previous research has shown that dominant individuals frequently think in terms of dominance hierarchies, which typically invoke vertical metaphor (e.g., “upper” vs. “lower” class). </span><span class="sentence">Accordingly, we predicted that in spatial attention paradigms, such individuals would systematically favor the vertical dimension of space more than individuals low in dominance. </span><span class="sentence">This prediction was supported by two studies (total N = 96), which provided three tests involving two different spatial attention paradigms. </span><span class="sentence">In all cases, analyses controlling for speed of response to horizontal spatial probes revealed that more dominant individuals were faster than less dominant individuals to respond to probes along the vertical dimension of space. </span><span class="sentence">Such data support the metaphor-representation perspective, according to which people think in metaphoric terms, even in on-line processing tasks. </span><span class="sentence">These results have implications for understanding dominance and also indicate that conceptual metaphor is relevant to understanding the cognitive-processing basis of personality.</span>
