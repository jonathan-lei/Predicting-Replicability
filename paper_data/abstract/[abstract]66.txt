<span class="sentence">How does temporal selection work, and along what dimensions does it vary from one instance to the next? </span><span class="sentence">We explored these questions using a phenomenon in which temporal selection goes awry. </span><span class="sentence">In the attentional blink, subjects fail to report the second of a pair of targets (T1 and T2) when they are presented at stimulus onset asyn-chronies (SOAs) of roughly 200 to 500 ms. </span><span class="sentence">We directly tested the properties of temporal selection during the blink by analyzing distractor intrusions at a fast rate of item presentation. </span><span class="sentence">Our analysis shows that attentional selection is (a) suppressed, (b) delayed, and (c) diffused in time during the attentional blink. </span><span class="sentence">These effects are dissociated by their time course: The measure of each effect returns to the baseline value at a different SOA. </span><span class="sentence">Our results constrain theories of the attentional blink and indicate that temporal selection varies along at least three dissociable dimensions: efficacy, latency, and precision.</span>
