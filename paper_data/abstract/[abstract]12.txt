<span class="sentence">      Recent evidence suggests that the processes responsible for generating a phonological code from print are flexible in skilled readers. </span><span class="sentence">An important goal, therefore, is to identify the conditions that lead to changes in how a phonological code is computed. </span><span class="sentence">Five experiments are reported that examine whether phonological processes change as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis when reading aloud words and nonwords. </span><span class="sentence">Changes in reading processes were assessed by measuring the effect of predictable switches between stimulus categories across trials. </span><span class="sentence">The results of the present experiments are argued to be consistent with the pathway control hypothesis.</span>
