<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">To examine the possibility that an informed guessing strategy was responsible for producing the outcome of RB for words but repetition advantage for nonwords, we first needed to replicate this finding. </button><button class="sentence">In the majority of Coltheart and Langdon's (2003) experiments, word and nonword trials were presented in separate blocks. </button><button class="sentence">Unfortunately, this complicates the interpretation of results from these experiments, because presenting words and nonwords in separate blocks can lead to the use of different strategies for reporting words and nonwords. </button><button class="sentence">Accordingly, Experiment 1 was designed as a replication of Coltheart and Langdon's Experiment 6, in which word and nonword trials were intermixed.</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Twenty-four Iowa State University undergraduates participated for course credit. </button><button class="sentence">All were native speakers of English; 3 were bilingual.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Following Coltheart and Langdon (2003), we selected 72 monosyllabic words and 72 pronounceable nonwords; nonwords were selected from the ARC Nonword Database (Rastle, Harrington, &amp; Coltheart, 2002). </button><button class="sentence">All items were 4 letters in length and were monosyllabic. </button><button class="sentence">Orthographic neighborhood size (orthographic N) was included as a factor in the design; half the words and nonwords had an orthographic N of 12 or greater, and the other half had an orthographic N of 5 or less. </button><button class="sentence">High-N and low-N words were similar in print frequency (15 per million; Francis &amp; Kučera, 1982). </button><button class="sentence">On the basis of the literature investigating N effects in naming tasks (see Andrews, 1997, for a review), we did not expect large differences in report of high-N and low-N words, but considering the difficulty of reporting nonwords displayed in RSVP, we expected that high-N nonwords would be better encoded than would low-N nonwords. </button><button class="sentence">Thus, we predicted that it might be easier to demonstrate RB for high-N nonwords than for low-N nonwords.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The high-N and low-N items were each divided into three sets of 12 items for counterbalancing purposes, and the sets were matched on N and print frequency (mean N sizes per set were 14.8, 14.7, and 14.3 for the high-N words; 13.9, 13.9, and 13.9 for the high-N nonwords; 3.8, 3.8, and 3.8 for the low-N words; and 3.1, 3.2, and 3.1 for the low-N nonwords). </button><button class="sentence">Sequences of 3 words or 3 nonwords were created with the first and last words or nonwords designated C1 and C2. </button><button class="sentence">These were then made into 6-item RSVP streams by displaying rows of symbols (e.g., %%%%, ####) as the first, second, and sixth items in each RSVP stream. </button><button class="sentence">The words or nonwords occupied the third, fourth, and fifth positions in each RSVP stream. </button><button class="sentence">Stimulus sets 1 and 2 were used to create the repeated condition, where C1 and C2 were identical. </button><button class="sentence">The control condition was created from the repeated condition by substituting a word from Stimulus set 3 for C1. </button><button class="sentence">Words or nonwords intervening between C1 and C2 were selected from a separate pool of items having N sizes between 5 and 12. </button><button class="sentence">Two versions of the stimulus list were created such that each participant viewed 12 three-word lists in the high-N repeated condition, 12 in the high-N control condition, 12 in the low-N repeated condition, and 12 in the low-N control condition. </button><button class="sentence">The same was true for the 3-nonword lists. </button><button class="sentence">Each participant also viewed 40 RSVP streams with only 2 words or nonwords (a row of symbols was substituted for the intervening word or nonword). </button><button class="sentence">Each participant saw each critical word or nonword only once. </button><button class="sentence">In both versions of the stimulus list, word and nonword lists were randomly intermixed. </button><button class="sentence">All stimulus items used in Experiments 1 and 2 are shown in the Appendix (additional stimulus items used in Experiments 3–6 may be obtained from Alison L.

The RSVP stream was then displayed with each item appearing for 126 ms. Following the RSVP stream, a “?” was displayed to indicate that the participant should report the items. </button><button class="sentence">The next trial began immediately after the experimenter keyed in the participant's response. </button><button class="sentence">All stimuli were displayed in a white font (36 pt.
