<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">METHOD</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">Told they were participating in a memory task, 36 single male Canadian undergraduates read an excerpt from a British newspaper. </span><span class="sentence">The excerpt used in the system-threat condition threatened their belief in the legitimacy of their federal system, offering the opinion of a foreign journalist who believed the social, economic, and political climate in Canada was worsening. </span><span class="sentence">In the no-system-threat condition, the excerpt described the social, economic, and political climate in Canada as relatively stable and positive (see Kay, Jost, &amp; Young, 2005).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Participants then rated their romantic interest in each of eight profiled women. </span><span class="sentence">Each profile included a picture and self-description, ostensibly taken from a dating Web site. </span><span class="sentence">Half of the profiles portrayed the women as embodying the three dimensions of benevolent sexism identified by Glick and Fiske (1996); that is, these women were portrayed as vulnerable, pure, and ideal for making men feel complete. </span><span class="sentence">The portrayals in the other four profiles were inconsistent with the benevolent sexist stereotype in various ways; for example, the women were presented as career oriented, party seeking, active in social causes, or athletic. </span><span class="sentence">The profiles were presented randomly, with the only constraint being that two stereotypical or two nonstereotypical profiles could not be presented sequentially.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">After viewing each profile, participants used 7-point scales to answer eight questions gauging their romantic interest. </span><span class="sentence">They reported the extent to which they found the woman attractive, were interested in chatting with her on-line, would like to get to know her better, would like to meet her personally, would likely invite her to a party, would be pleased to have a date with her, were interested in starting a relationship with her, and viewed her as the ideal romantic partner. </span><span class="sentence">We then calculated an index of romantic interest in the benevolent-stereotypic women (α = .97) and non-benevolent-stereotypic women (α = .97).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">To ensure that any differences in romantic interest across the profiles were not due to differences in the pictures, we randomly paired pictures with self-descriptions for each participant; furthermore, pretesting verified that all pictures were viewed as equally attractive, <i>F</i> &lt; 1.</span></p>
