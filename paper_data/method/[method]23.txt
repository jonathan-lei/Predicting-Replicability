<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">On the basis of the preceding analysis, we predict that following commitment to a chosen course of action, relative left frontal cortical activity should be increased, and this increase in relative left frontal cortical activity should be associated with the degree of change in attitudes in support of the chosen course of action. </button><button class="sentence">Previous research has revealed that a commitment to a chosen course of action results in the increase of relative left frontal cortical activity (Harmon-Jones, Gerdjikov, &amp; Harmon-Jones, in press). </button><button class="sentence">Moreover, this commitment (high-choice) caused attitudes to be more consistent with the behavior, as compared with a low-commitment (low-choice) condition. </button><button class="sentence">However, in past research, relative left frontal activation did not relate to attitudes, perhaps because the attitude measure lacked the needed sensitivity (e.g., it did not tap attitude change from precommitment, but only tapped attitudes following the commitment).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">In past research, when the psychological process (commitment to a chosen course of action) was manipulated and the proposed physiological substrate was measured (left frontal cortical activation), commitment to a chosen course of action increased relative left frontal cortical activation (Harmon-Jones et al., in press). </button><button class="sentence">To provide stronger causal inferences regarding the role of the left frontal cortical region in following through with the commitment (discrepancy reduction), it is important to manipulate the physiology and measure the psychological outcome. </button><button class="sentence">Manipulation of the mediator also provides stronger causal evidence than simply correlating the proposed mediator with the outcome (Sigall &amp; Mills, 1998; Spencer, Zanna, &amp; Fong, 2005). </button><button class="sentence">In Experiment 1, after participants made a difficult decision, participants' relative left frontal cortical activity was manipulated, and then attitudinal spreading of alternatives was measured.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">To manipulate relative left frontal cortical activity, we used neurofeedback training of EEG, also called EEG biofeedback training. </button><button class="sentence">Neurofeedback presents the participant with real-time feedback on brainwave activity. </button><button class="sentence">The feedback can be presented in the form of a video display, vibration, or sound. </button><button class="sentence">If brainwave activity over a particular cortical region changes in the direction desired by the experiment, then the participant is given “reward” feedback; if brainwave activity does not change in the desired direction, then either negative feedback or no feedback is given. </button><button class="sentence">Rewards can be as simple as the presentation of a tone that informs the participant that brain activity has changed in the desired way. </button><button class="sentence">Neurofeedback-induced changes result from operant conditioning, and as such, these changes in EEG can occur without awareness of how the brain activity changes occurred (Kamiya, 1979; Siniatchkin, Kropp, &amp; Gerber, 2000). </button><button class="sentence">This is not to say that it is impossible for a participant to become aware of how she or he caused the changes in brain activity, but research suggests that such awareness requires extensive practice (e.g., 8 weeks of practice; Kotchoubey, Kübler, Strehl, Flor, &amp; Birbaumer, 2002), whereas the changes in brain activity due to conditioning occur much more quickly.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">In past research with clinically depressed individuals, neurofeedback training was used to increase relative left frontal activity, and it led to less depression after approximately 27 training sessions (Baehr, Rosenfeld, &amp; Baehr, 2001). </button><button class="sentence">In other research with nondepressed individuals, neurofeedback was effective at decreasing but not increasing relative left frontal activity after only 3 days of training. </button><button class="sentence">The decrease in relative left frontal activity brought about with this brief neurofeedback training caused less approach-related emotional responses (Allen, Harmon-Jones, &amp; Cavender, 2001). </button><button class="sentence">On the basis of these past results, we predicted that the decrease-left frontal condition would be more successful at changing brain activity than the increase-left frontal condition. </button><button class="sentence">Although past research with normal individuals revealed that brief neurofeedback failed to increase relative left frontal activity, we included this condition to have a proper neurofeedback comparison condition for the decrease-left condition and to give the increase-left neurofeedback another chance to produce significant brainwave changes.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Most important, we predicted that a decrease in relative left frontal activity would lead to a decrease in discrepancy reduction as measured by spreading of alternatives. </button><button class="sentence">To test these predictions, we used the decision paradigm based on the one developed by Brehm (1956).</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Overview</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants underwent 2 days of neurofeedback training designed to increase or decrease relative left frontal cortical activity. </button><button class="sentence">On the third day, after making a difficult decision, they underwent another neurofeedback training session of the same direction as previous days (increase vs. decrease left). </button><button class="sentence">Finally, participants rerated their decision alternatives. </button><button class="sentence">We predicted a manipulated decrease, as compared with increase, in relative left frontal cortical activity would cause a reduction in spreading of alternatives.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Procedures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were 33 female introductory psychology students who participated in exchange for extra credit toward their grade on Day 1 and then for $10 per hour on Days 2 and 3.

Poulsbo, WA), bandpass-filtered 1-35 Hz, and sampled at 256 Hz. Alpha power was computed, by bandpass filtering (8–13 Hz) and then rectifying the signals (1-s epochs). </button><button class="sentence">EEG alpha power over the frontal cortices is inversely related to activity over the same cortical regions measured using other methods such as positron emission tomography (Cook, O'Hara, Uijtdehaage, Mandelkern, &amp; Leuchter, 1998), functional magnetic resonance imaging (Goldman, Stern, Engel, &amp; Cohen, 2002), and behavioral methods (Davidson, Chapman, Chapman, &amp; Henriques, 1990; Lindsley &amp; Wicke, 1974). </button><button class="sentence">Recent source localization work has revealed that approach/withdrawal-related frontal EEG alpha asymmetry reflects dorsolateral prefrontal cortical activity (Pizzagalli, Sherwood, Henriques, &amp; Davidson, 2005).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">On Day 1, baseline EEG was acquired for 8 min. </button><button class="sentence">After that period, a separate experimenter, who did not interact with the participant, computed the participant's mean frontal difference and standard deviation. </button><button class="sentence">This second experimenter was used so that the experimenter who interacted with participants was blind to condition. </button><button class="sentence">Then, this second experimenter used the mean and standard deviation to establish a criterion value for the next block of neurofeedback training. </button><button class="sentence">The criterion value was the mean of the previous block of EEG recording + 0.85 <em>SD</em> for participants in the <em>increase-left</em> frontal condition; it was −0.85 <em>SD</em> for participants in the <em>decrease-left</em> condition. </button><button class="sentence">For Day 2, the criterion value was determined from the mean frontal difference and standard deviation of the last 16 min on Day 1.
