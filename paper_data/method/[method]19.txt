<h4>Experiment 7: Effect of Satisfaction</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Overview</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Like Experiment 6, Experiment 7 was designed to determine whether goals are implicated in the effects of the action and inaction primes obtained in Experiments 1–5. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were first primed with action, control, or inaction words and then engaged in a brief randomly assigned task that could be either active (doodling) or inactive (resting). </button><button class="sentence">After the task, participants read a text and wrote down their thoughts about it. A greater number of listed thoughts was taken as an indication of greater cognitive activity and should be greater when participants have an action goal rather than when they have an inaction goal.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The inclusion of the task was designed to test whether the effects of the primes are discontinued when people perform behaviors that can satisfy the goal (Bargh et al., 2001; Kruglanski et al., 2002; Moskowitz et al., 2004). </button><button class="sentence">An action goal should be present when participants were primed with action and had no opportunity to be active, and an inaction goal should be activated when participants were primed with inaction and had no opportunity to be inactive. </button><button class="sentence">In contrast, if the effects of the primes are goal mediated, action and inaction primes followed by an immediate prime-consistent task should have a different effect. </button><button class="sentence">In particular, these satisfied action goals should yield less activity than would unsatisfied action goals, and satisfied inaction goals should yield more activity than would unsatisfied inaction goals. </button><button class="sentence">Whether satisfied goals return to baseline level of efforts (i.e., no different from control-prime conditions) is an empirical question. </button><button class="sentence">Satisfied action goals may either produce the same effort as control conditions, more effort than control conditions, or less effort than control conditions. </button><button class="sentence">All these possibilities would indicate that goal satisfaction decreased striving toward the desired outcome. </button><button class="sentence">Finding the same or more effort would indicate mere deactivation of the goal, whereas less effort would indicate the sort of rebound effect that is occasionally observed in studies of goal satisfaction (Marsh et al., 1998).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants in this study were primed with action words, control words, or inaction words using the word-completion task used previously. </button><button class="sentence">At that time, half of the participants were asked to take a break and relax with their eyes closed, whereas the other half was asked to doodle or fold a piece of paper into an airplane. </button><button class="sentence">If goals are at stake, relaxing would satisfy inaction goals but not action goals, whereas doodling/folding would satisfy action goals but not inaction goals. </button><button class="sentence">Following the manipulation of goal satisfaction, all participants received a passage about vegetarianism and listed their thoughts about the text.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Participants and Design</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were 98 students at the University of Florida who participated in exchange for credit in an introductory psychology class. </button><button class="sentence">The design was a 3 (prime: action, control, or inaction) × 2 (task: active vs. inactive) factorial.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Procedures and Measures</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">We introduced the action, control, and inaction primes as part of the previously used word-completion task. </button><button class="sentence">Then, we introduced the manipulated active or inactive task and gave participants a text to read.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Active and inactive task</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">After the word-completion task, we explained to participants that there would be a 2-min break with the ostensible objective of clearing their mind. </button><button class="sentence">Participants in inactive-task conditions received instructions to rest, closing their eyes and waiting to proceed after the 2 min elapsed. </button><button class="sentence">In contrast, participants in active-task conditions were asked to engage in physical movement. </button><button class="sentence">Specifically, we indicated that a piece of paper had been provided at their workstations to facilitate movement and that they should fold it into a paper airplane or doodle on the paper. </button><button class="sentence">We requested that they engage in the task silently until the computer proceeded to the next screen after 2 min passed.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Text reading</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The informational passage about vegetarianism contained approximately 500 words and included scientific evidence about the effects of vegetarianism. </button><button class="sentence">Participants read the text at their own pace and were then asked to list their thoughts about it.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Thought listing</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">After reading the text, participants received instructions to type the thoughts they had while reading the text on a computer. </button><button class="sentence">For analyses, we counted the number of thoughts listed by each participant.</button></p>
