<h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were seventy-five undergraduates (62 women and 13 men) who participated for partial course credit. </span><span class="sentence">They ranged in age from 17–21 years (<em>M</em> = 18.46, <em>SD</em> = 0.72). </span><span class="sentence">Ethnic groups included 72% White, 17% African American, 2.5% Asian, 7% Hispanic, and 1.5% Native American.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were seated at a computer and asked to complete several measures. </span><span class="sentence">Of interest were indirect AMP evaluations, direct AMP evaluations, and racial-attitude questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence">Indirect and direct evaluations were completed in a counterbalanced order, followed by the questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence">Participants next provided demographic information and were debriefed.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>AMP</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Indirect evaluations</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">For the indirect rating trials, participants were presented with one of three kinds of primes: a Black face, a White face, or a gray square that served as a neutral prime. </span><span class="sentence">The face primes were 12 Black men and 12 White men. </span><span class="sentence">The pictures showed only the model's face, with a neutral facial expression. </span><span class="sentence">Based on pilot testing, the Black and White photos were matched on attractiveness and were selected to be highly prototypical of their respective racial category.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The prime appeared in the center of the screen for 100 ms, followed by a blank screen for 100 ms and then a Chinese pictograph for 100 ms (see Figure 1). </span><span class="sentence">Following the pictograph, a patterned mask of black and white “noise” appeared. </span><span class="sentence">At the bottom of the screen was a 4-point rating scale that included −2 (<em>very unpleasant</em>), −1 (<em>slightly unpleasant</em>), +1 (<em>slightly pleasant</em>), and + 2 (<em>very pleasant</em>). </span><span class="sentence">After participants provided their evaluation of the pictograph, the next trial began. </span><span class="sentence">A total of 72 randomly ordered trials were presented, with 24 neutral, 24 Black, and 24 White primes paired with 72 unique Chinese pictographs. </span><span class="sentence">For each participant, the computer paired a pictograph with a prime in a new random order.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were told that the task was about making judgments while avoiding distraction. </span><span class="sentence">They were instructed to rate the pleasantness of the Chinese pictographs using the rating scale. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were warned to not let their rating of the pictographs be influenced by the preceding photo. </span><span class="sentence">This warning was included to ensure that AMP responses represented the effect of the prime, despite participants' attempts at correction, thereby serving as an indication of the automatic influence of prime-invoked attitudes (Payne, Cheng, et al., 2005). </span><span class="sentence">The instructions read as follows:</span></p><blockquote><span class="sentence">For this round of judgments you should <b><i>rate the Chinese characters</i></b>. </span><span class="sentence">Please note that sometimes the photos flashed prior to the characters can influence people's ratings of the Chinese characters. </span><span class="sentence">Please try your best not to be influenced by the photographs. </span><span class="sentence">Instead, <b><i>please give us an honest judgment of how pleasant or unpleasant is your reaction to each Chinese character</i></b>. </span><span class="sentence">Of course, there are no right or wrong answers. </span><span class="sentence">Just report your “gut reaction.” [Emphasis was in the original.]</span></blockquote><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Direct evaluations</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The direct rating procedure was identical to the indirect rating procedure with three exceptions. </span><span class="sentence">The first and most important difference was that participants were instructed to rate their evaluations of the prime photographs and to avoid being influenced by the Chinese pictographs. </span><span class="sentence">Because the pictographs were ambiguous and randomly paired with the primes, they could not actually exert any systematic influence on ratings of the primes. </span><span class="sentence">The instructions read as follows:</span></p><blockquote><span class="sentence">For this round of judgments you should <b>rate the photos of people</b>. </span><span class="sentence">Please note that sometimes the Chinese characters flashed after the photos can influence people's ratings of the photos. </span><span class="sentence">Please try your best not to be influenced by the characters. </span><span class="sentence">Instead, <b>please give us an honest judgment of how pleasant or unpleasant is your reaction to each person's photo</b>. </span><span class="sentence">Of course, there are no right or wrong answers. </span><span class="sentence">Just report your “gut reaction.”</span></blockquote><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The second difference was that no neutral primes were included, because direct evaluations of a gray square would be uninformative. </span><span class="sentence">The third difference was that only 24 trials were included, one trial for each unique prime photo. </span><span class="sentence">In the direct rating blocks, each prime photo was rated only once for the same reason that each item is only presented once on questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence">Because participants were directly expressing their attitudes toward the attitude objects, there was little need for repetitive judgments of the same items.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Self-Report Attitude Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Two self-report measures of racial attitudes were used: the MRS (McConahay, 1983) and the ATB (Brigham, 1993). </span><span class="sentence">The MRS is a 7-item assessment of anti-Black attitudes and includes items such as “Over the past few years, the government and news media have shown more respect to blacks then they deserve.” </span><span class="sentence">Responses were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 9 (<em>strongly agree</em>). </span><span class="sentence">The ATB is a 20-item assessment that includes items such as “Black and White people are inherently equal” and “It is likely that Blacks will bring violence to neighborhoods when they move in.” </span><span class="sentence">Responses were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 9 (<em>strongly agree</em>).</span></p>
