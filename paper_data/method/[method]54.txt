<h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were seventy-five undergraduates (62 women and 13 men) who participated for partial course credit. </button><button class="sentence">They ranged in age from 17–21 years (<em>M</em> = 18.46, <em>SD</em> = 0.72). </button><button class="sentence">Ethnic groups included 72% White, 17% African American, 2.5% Asian, 7% Hispanic, and 1.5% Native American.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were seated at a computer and asked to complete several measures. </button><button class="sentence">Of interest were indirect AMP evaluations, direct AMP evaluations, and racial-attitude questionnaires. </button><button class="sentence">Indirect and direct evaluations were completed in a counterbalanced order, followed by the questionnaires. </button><button class="sentence">Participants next provided demographic information and were debriefed.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>AMP</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Indirect evaluations</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">For the indirect rating trials, participants were presented with one of three kinds of primes: a Black face, a White face, or a gray square that served as a neutral prime. </button><button class="sentence">The face primes were 12 Black men and 12 White men. </button><button class="sentence">The pictures showed only the model's face, with a neutral facial expression. </button><button class="sentence">Based on pilot testing, the Black and White photos were matched on attractiveness and were selected to be highly prototypical of their respective racial category.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The prime appeared in the center of the screen for 100 ms, followed by a blank screen for 100 ms and then a Chinese pictograph for 100 ms (see Figure 1). </button><button class="sentence">Following the pictograph, a patterned mask of black and white “noise” appeared. </button><button class="sentence">At the bottom of the screen was a 4-point rating scale that included −2 (<em>very unpleasant</em>), −1 (<em>slightly unpleasant</em>), +1 (<em>slightly pleasant</em>), and + 2 (<em>very pleasant</em>). </button><button class="sentence">After participants provided their evaluation of the pictograph, the next trial began. </button><button class="sentence">A total of 72 randomly ordered trials were presented, with 24 neutral, 24 Black, and 24 White primes paired with 72 unique Chinese pictographs. </button><button class="sentence">For each participant, the computer paired a pictograph with a prime in a new random order.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were told that the task was about making judgments while avoiding distraction. </button><button class="sentence">They were instructed to rate the pleasantness of the Chinese pictographs using the rating scale. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were warned to not let their rating of the pictographs be influenced by the preceding photo. </button><button class="sentence">This warning was included to ensure that AMP responses represented the effect of the prime, despite participants' attempts at correction, thereby serving as an indication of the automatic influence of prime-invoked attitudes (Payne, Cheng, et al., 2005). </button><button class="sentence">The instructions read as follows:</button></p><blockquote><button class="sentence">For this round of judgments you should <b><i>rate the Chinese characters</i></b>. </button><button class="sentence">Please note that sometimes the photos flashed prior to the characters can influence people's ratings of the Chinese characters. </button><button class="sentence">Please try your best not to be influenced by the photographs. </button><button class="sentence">Instead, <b><i>please give us an honest judgment of how pleasant or unpleasant is your reaction to each Chinese character</i></b>. </button><button class="sentence">Of course, there are no right or wrong answers. </button><button class="sentence">Just report your “gut reaction.” [Emphasis was in the original.]</button></blockquote><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Direct evaluations</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The direct rating procedure was identical to the indirect rating procedure with three exceptions. </button><button class="sentence">The first and most important difference was that participants were instructed to rate their evaluations of the prime photographs and to avoid being influenced by the Chinese pictographs. </button><button class="sentence">Because the pictographs were ambiguous and randomly paired with the primes, they could not actually exert any systematic influence on ratings of the primes. </button><button class="sentence">The instructions read as follows:</button></p><blockquote><button class="sentence">For this round of judgments you should <b>rate the photos of people</b>. </button><button class="sentence">Please note that sometimes the Chinese characters flashed after the photos can influence people's ratings of the photos. </button><button class="sentence">Please try your best not to be influenced by the characters. </button><button class="sentence">Instead, <b>please give us an honest judgment of how pleasant or unpleasant is your reaction to each person's photo</b>. </button><button class="sentence">Of course, there are no right or wrong answers. </button><button class="sentence">Just report your “gut reaction.”</button></blockquote><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The second difference was that no neutral primes were included, because direct evaluations of a gray square would be uninformative. </button><button class="sentence">The third difference was that only 24 trials were included, one trial for each unique prime photo. </button><button class="sentence">In the direct rating blocks, each prime photo was rated only once for the same reason that each item is only presented once on questionnaires. </button><button class="sentence">Because participants were directly expressing their attitudes toward the attitude objects, there was little need for repetitive judgments of the same items.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Self-Report Attitude Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Two self-report measures of racial attitudes were used: the MRS (McConahay, 1983) and the ATB (Brigham, 1993). </button><button class="sentence">The MRS is a 7-item assessment of anti-Black attitudes and includes items such as “Over the past few years, the government and news media have shown more respect to blacks then they deserve.” </button><button class="sentence">Responses were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 9 (<em>strongly agree</em>). </button><button class="sentence">The ATB is a 20-item assessment that includes items such as “Black and White people are inherently equal” and “It is likely that Blacks will bring violence to neighborhoods when they move in.” </button><button class="sentence">Responses were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 9 (<em>strongly agree</em>).</button></p>
