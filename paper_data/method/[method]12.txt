<h4>Experiment 1</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 1 examined a simple prediction of the pathway control hypothesis by having participants read <strong data-auto="strong_text">aloud</strong> high-frequency exception words and nonwords in a predictable AABB sequence. If exception words are read <strong data-auto="strong_text">aloud</strong> by emphasizing the lexical route and nonwords are read <strong data-auto="strong_text">aloud</strong> by emphasizing the nonlexical route, then switch costs should be observed when switching between lexical categories. <sup/></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Participants</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Sixteen undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada were each paid $4.00 to participate in the present experiment. All individuals had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were native English speakers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Stimuli</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 1 used 50 high-frequency exception words (as defined by DRC; mean frequency = 311 according the Celex database; Baayen, Piepenbrock, &amp; van Rijn, 1993) and 50 nonwords (see Appendix A). The nonwords were generated by rotating the onsets and bodies in the exception words where possible. Therefore, 97% of the unique orthographic bodies from the exception words were repeated in the nonwords.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Apparatus</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Stimulus presentation was controlled by a Pentium IV 1.8 GHz computer running Eprime 1.1 software (Schneider, Eschman, &amp; Zuccolotto, 2001). Vocal responses were collected using a Plantronics LS1 microphone headset (Santa Cruz, CA) and a voice-key assembly. Stimuli were displayed on a 17-inch (43.18-cm) ADI Microscan monitor (Taipei, Taiwan).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Procedure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The type of stimulus used on the initial trial (e.g., exception word or nonword) and whether a particular item would occur in a switch or stay context were counterbalanced across participants. Participants were assigned to one of four counterbalance conditions on the basis of the order in which they arrived in the lab.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were tested individually and were seated approximately 50 cm from the computer monitor. A practice block consisted of eight trials to familiarize participants with the procedure. At the end of the practice session, participants were given limited feedback about their performance. Feedback about accuracy was limited to the regularizations of the exception words, lexicalizations of the nonwords, hesitations, and the addition or subtraction of phonemes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> block consisted of 100 trials. Each trial began with a fixation marker (“+”) displayed at the center of the screen. The fixation marker remained on the screen for 1,000 ms, followed by a blank screen for 250 ms, and then the target, which remained on the screen until a vocal response was made. Once the stimulus disappeared, the screen remained blank for 1,000 ms before the next trial began. Thus, the response–stimulus interval was 2,250 ms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Responses were classified by the experimenter during the response–stimulus interval as correct, incorrect, or voice-key failure. A pronunciation error was defined as an utterance that represented a clear mispronunciation of the word or nonword (i.e., an extra or deleted phoneme, hesitation or pause, stutter, regularization of the exception words, or lexicalization of the nonwords).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were asked to read the letter strings <strong data-auto="strong_text">aloud</strong> quickly and accurately. Exception words were described as words that do not sound like they look. Nonwords were described as stimuli that could be words but were not. Participants were told that the type of stimulus followed a predictable AABB sequence but were not given any explicit instructions about how to read the nonwords.</p>
