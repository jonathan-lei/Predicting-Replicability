<h3>Study 4: Buttressing the Self</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 3 suggests that <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong> are resented by actors because of the perception that they would, if they could, reject others who do not take a similar position. This fits our model, which posits that the imagined <strong data-auto="strong_text">rejection</strong> perceived in <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong> is a threat to one's sense of adequacy (Hypothesis 3). As we have noted, the <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> in our studies is actually not in a position to judge participants, but we argue that the simple fact that someone could look down on them can shake participants' self-confidence, and it is this sting that triggers the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rejection</strong>. Having shown the role of imagined reproach in Study 3, in Study 4 we proceeded to show the implication of the self. Specifically, we reasoned that if the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rejection</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong> indeed results from shaking participants' self-confidence, then actors should not feel a need to reject <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong> if they have been secured in their sense of being a good, effective person (Prediction 3a).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Spencer et al. (2001) showed that after receiving bogus negative feedback on an intelligence test, participants chose to listen to a poorly performing peer in preparation for a later interview. However, when participants had had the chance to write about an important value, they preferred to listen to a highly performing peer. Apparently, this opportunity to self-affirm made an impressive peer more palatable, despite the recent setback of the intelligence test. Along similar lines, and in line with self-affirmation theory (Sherman &amp; Cohen, 2006; Steele, 1988), we predicted that buttressing participants' sense of adequacy by giving them a chance to reflect on one of their important values or qualities would shield them from the sting of imagined <strong data-auto="strong_text">rejection</strong> and would therefore reduce the need to put down <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong> (Prediction 3a).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In essence, we predicted that self-affirmed actors in Study 4 would resemble uninvolved observers in Studies 1–3. Prior research suggests that self-affirmation can reduce the tendency to deny or skew information that is threatening to one's beliefs, and thus reduce the impact of one's initial point of view on the processing of new information (e.g., Cohen, Aronson, &amp; Steele,2000). We predicted that self-affirmation would similarly give actors some distance, both reducing their need to reject the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> (Prediction 3a, above) and allowing them to recognize the value of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong>'s behavior as a <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong>, agentic choice—possibly to the point of questioning their own (Prediction 3b).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A secondary goal of Study 4 was to determine whether the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rejection</strong> of a <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> serves to reduce the kind of negative affect or psychological discomfort assumed to accompany cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957). We thus added measures of self-reported affect and discomfort, varying whether they were presented before or after the opportunity to put down the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong>. The placement of these measures could be important, because if a process serves to reduce discomfort, then discomfort should be high when measured before it but lower when measured after (cf. Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994).</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Seventy-nine undergraduates at a large U.S. private university (47 Whites, 17 Asians, 9 Hispanics, 3 Native Americans, 2 non-Black multiracial, and 1 Iranian; 52 men, 27 women) came to the laboratory to complete the research participation requirement of an introductory <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> class or in exchange of a payment of $8. The experimenter was a White man.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: obedient, <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> control, or <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> self-affirmation. All participants in this study were actors (i.e., completed the police decision task first) and saw a compliant other in the first condition, or a <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> other in the other two. Before rating the other, participants wrote a personal essay in the self-affirmation condition or listed foods in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> control and obedient conditions. We also included two different orders within the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> control condition to look at a possible order effect on affect measures (cf. Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994), but we collapsed these two conditions into one for simplicity after discovering that this order made no difference (see the <em>Placement of affect measures</em> section).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants came to the laboratory to take part in a decision-making study and were told that they would make decisions, form impressions of other students, and fill out some mood and emotion questionnaires. They first completed the police decision task from Study 3. The experimenter, sitting with his back toward participants for the duration of the study, then came by with a clipboard and ostensibly made a note of the participant's choice in the task. After this, participants wrote a personal essay or listed foods they had eaten (see below). After 8 min, the experimenter told participants that they would switch to forming impressions of a past participant and gave them a blank rating sheet and a completed version of the police decision task (containing the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> vs. obedient manipulation) ostensibly taken randomly from a stack of completed questionnaires. The other participant was always White, age 19, and matched in gender with the participants. Participants' own completed decision task was left on the table, face up, next to the one allegedly completed by the other student—and it was left there until the end of the study to make sure it remained salient to participants. After indicating their impression of the other participant, participants rated their affective state on a list of traits (half the participants in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> control condition did this first) and answered the questions about the situation and about expected <strong data-auto="strong_text">rejection</strong> introduced in Study 3.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Self-Affirmation Manipulation</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> self-affirmation condition, participants read the following instructions:
<blockquote>Please write about a recent experience in which you demonstrated a quality or value that is very important to you and which made you feel good about yourself. Examples of “personally important values or quality” might include (but are not limited to) artistic skills, sense of humor, social skills, spontaneity, athletic ability, musical talent, physical attractiveness, creativity, business skills, or romantic values.</blockquote> Participants named their chosen quality or value, rated its personal importance on a scale from 0 (<em>not important at all</em>) to 4 (<em>extremely important</em>), then described their experience on the blank lines provided on the rest of the page in the remaining 8 min. Participants in the obedient or <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> control conditions instead read the following instructions: “Please describe everything you have eaten or drunk in the past 48 hours. Do not worry about things you find yourself unable to remember,” followed by blank lines on the rest of the page. <sup/></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Ratings were similar to previous studies, with some small changes. Participants indicated how much they would like to work on a project with the other participant and how much they would like him or her as a friend, both on an 11-point scale ranging from −5 (<em>dislike very much</em>) to + 5 (<em>like very much</em>), with an unlabeled midpoint of 0. They indicated how much they respected the other participant on a similar 11-point scale ranging from −5 (<em>despise a great deal</em>) to +5 (<em>respect a great deal</em>), then indicated the <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> trait that they thought best described the other participant (open ended), and finally rated the other participant on the 14 semantic differentials on 7-point scales with a midpoint of 0 (<em>neither</em>) and with the following poles: <em>stupid–intelligent</em>, <em>strong–weak</em>, <em>unpleasant–pleasant</em>, <em>funny–not funny</em>, <em>confident–insecure, immature–mature</em>, <em>active–passive</em>, <em>cruel–kind</em>, <em>nice–awful</em>, <em>cold–warm, honest–dishonest</em>, <em>unfair–fair</em>, <em><strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong>–immoral</em>, and <em>dependent–independent</em>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">On the following page, participants rated their own morality relative to other students on campus on a scale ranging from 0% (<em>you are the least <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong> student on campus</em>) to 100% (<em>you are the most <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong> student on campus</em>) and a midpoint of 50% (<em>average</em>). Then, under the heading “mood and emotion survey,” they answered the question “How do you feel <u>right now</u>?” by rating each of the following 24 states on a scale ranging from 1 (<em>does not apply at all</em>) to 7 (<em>applies very much</em>): disappointed with myself, good, uncomfortable, happy with myself, determined, annoyed with myself, happy, guilty, comfortable with myself, peaceful, uneasy, disgusted with myself, excited, pleased with myself, energetic, angry with myself, bothered, friendly, dissatisfied with myself, fatigued, self-critical, optimistic, secure with myself, and lonely.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, participants rated his or her agreement with the following items introduced in Study 3 on a 7-point scale ranging from −3 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to +3 (<em>strongly agree</em>): “I am very happy with my choice of a suspect”; “My choice is representative of my attitudes and values”; “Anyone would have picked the same suspect as I did”; “The information presented was sufficient to lead me to the correct choice”; and “I had no other choice but to select the most obvious subject.” On the same page, they indicated how the other participant would like and respect them after seeing their own answers on the police decision making task, using the first three scales used to rate the other participant.</p>
