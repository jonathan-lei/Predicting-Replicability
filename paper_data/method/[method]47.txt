<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Study 2: A Closer Look at the Capability–Forgiveness Link</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Study 1 demonstrated a link between personal capability and forgiveness. </span><span class="sentence">Next, we wanted to follow the strategy of a previous article on narcissistic entitlement and forgiveness (Exline, Baumeister, et al., 2004). </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, we hypothesized that personal capability would still have unique predictive power when other robust predictors of forgiveness were controlled. </span><span class="sentence">First, we examined situational predictors of forgiveness that were discussed in the introduction: relationship commitment and apology. </span><span class="sentence">We also examined several individual-difference factors that have been linked with forgiveness in prior research.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Earlier studies have shown that forgiveness levels correlate with the Big Five factors of personality, particularly low Neuroticism and high Agreeableness (e.g., Brown, 2003; McCullough &amp; Hoyt, 2002). </span><span class="sentence">Some other forgiveness predictors include high dispositional forgiveness (e.g., Berry, Worthington, O'Connor, Parrott, &amp; Wade, 2005), high self-esteem (e.g., Miller, 2003), low narcissism and entitlement (e.g., Brown, 2004; Exline, Baumeister, et al., 2004), high religiosity (see Worthington, 2005a, for a review), and high social desirability (e.g., Exline, Baumeister, et al., 2004).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We reasoned that several of these factors might correlate with personal capability as well. </span><span class="sentence">For example, a willingness to focus on one's flaws would seem unlikely in narcissistic people or those with a high sense of entitlement, because they tend to be defensive about focusing on their faults (e.g., Campbell, Bonacci, Shelton, Exline, &amp; Bushman, 2004). </span><span class="sentence">Competing predictions could be made about self-esteem: Given their positive self-views, people with high self-esteem could tend to downplay their potential for wrongdoing, much as narcissists do. </span><span class="sentence">However, their basic sense of security and confidence could enable them to admit shortcomings as well. </span><span class="sentence">Neurotic individuals might be highly aware of their personal capability for transgression, given their predispositions to focus on negative information (John, Donahue, &amp; Kentle, 1991), whereas conscientious people may carefully monitor their behavior and be quick to notice deviations from social rules. </span><span class="sentence">Because many religions emphasize the need to be accountable for transgressions, personal capability might correlate positively with religiosity. </span><span class="sentence">Finally, we reasoned that admitting moral flaws would be negatively linked with social desirability. </span><span class="sentence">Because any of these personality variables might serve as a confound, we examined whether the link between capability and forgiveness would remain significant when these factors were controlled.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We also evaluated the three potential mediators of the capability–forgiveness association outlined in the introduction: If personal capability is indeed linked with forgiveness, is this because offenses seem smaller when people can relate to them? </span><span class="sentence">Or is the link due to empathic understanding or seeing oneself as similar to the offender? </span><span class="sentence">We predicted that all three mediation explanations would be supported.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants (106 men, 112 women) were undergraduates in psychology courses at a private research university in Ohio. </span><span class="sentence">Ethnicities were predominantly Caucasian (69%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (19%). </span><span class="sentence">The mean age was 19.3 years ( <em>SD</em> = 3.7). </span><span class="sentence">Analyses of dispositional variables used a subset of participants ( <em>n</em> = 136; 68 men, 68 women) who had participated in another study that included an in-depth assessment of personality constructs.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">All participants completed a questionnaire for partial course credit. </span><span class="sentence">As part of the questionnaire, they were asked to recall a situation in which another person did something that deeply offended, harmed, or hurt them. </span><span class="sentence">After describing the situation, participants completed the measures described below. </span><span class="sentence">Participants included in the dispositional analyses participated in a Web-based study called “Emotions, Personality and Attitudes” (Exline &amp; Youngstrom, 2004). </span><span class="sentence">They gave written permission to have the results from the personality study linked with their results from this study.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures of Unforgiveness and Situational Factors</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Unless otherwise indicated, scales ranged from 0 ( <em>not at all</em>) to 10 ( <em>extremely</em>). </span><span class="sentence">We scored all measures by averaging across items. </span><span class="sentence">Measures are listed below in the order in which they appeared in the questionnaire. </span><span class="sentence">Descriptive statistics appear in Table 1.</span><br/><br/> <span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/psp-94-3-495-tbl1a.gif" alt="psp-94-3-495-tbl1a.gif"/><em>Study 2: Descriptive Statistics and Key Correlations</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Description of offense</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">First, participants were asked to provide a brief description of the offense. </span><span class="sentence">These responses were coded into various categories as described in the <em>Results</em>.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Offense severity</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants rated the extent to which the offense was severe, harmful, wrong, and intentional.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Preoffense relationship closeness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants responded to the items, “How close was your relationship with the other person before the offense occurred?” and “Prior to the offense, to what extent were you committed to having a positive relationship with the other person?”</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Apology and amends</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants rated the extent to which the other person had accepted responsibility for the offense, apologized, and taken action to repair the situation.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Unforgiveness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We used the 18-item Transgression Related Interpersonal Motivations Inventory–Revised (TRIM-18-R; McCullough &amp; Hoyt, 2002) to assess current motivations toward the offender. </span><span class="sentence">Participants responded to 18 items on a scale from 1 ( <em>strongly disagree</em>) to 5 ( <em>strongly agree</em>). </span><span class="sentence">We averaged scores for the three subscales (Vengefulness, Avoidance, reverse-scored Benevolence) to compute a TRIM score.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Capability for similar wrongdoing</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After completing several pages of additional questions about the offense (not relevant to this investigation), participants rated responses to four questions from 0 ( <em>no, definitely not</em>) to 10 ( <em>yes, definitely</em>): “Given the right circumstances, do you think that you could be capable of doing something just as bad (i.e., just as harmful or wrong) as what the other person did?”; “Can you imagine a situation in which you could do something as bad as what the other person did?”; “Do you think it's possible that you could ever do something as bad as what the other person did?”;
