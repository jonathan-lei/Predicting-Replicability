<h3>Experiment 5: How Does an Implemental Mind-Set Affect Attitude Strength?</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Throughout the previous studies, we have assumed that the mechanism behind an <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong>'s affect on <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">strength</strong> is the one-sided analysis of information that occurs after a decision is made. Of course, it is also possible that simply making a decision is sufficient to foster increased <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">strength</strong> in general, without necessitating a one-sided focus as the driving mechanism. Prior <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> work has never teased apart the act of deciding and the one- versus two-sided focus. This might not be surprising, however, given that individuals in a postdecisional state generally spontaneously tune their thoughts in a one-sided manner (Taylor &amp; Gollwitzer, 1995). Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to pinpoint the exact mechanism underlying the effect an <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> has on <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">strength</strong>. The current experiment <strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> out to examine this mechanism, with ambivalence and certainty as the focal aspects of <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">strength</strong> to test our hypothesis.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 46 former and current students (25 women, 21 men) recruited via several University of Chicago electronic postings (newsgroup site, Facebook, and listserve notification) who participated for $10. The procedure for collecting data was the same as that used in Experiments 2 and 4 with the following additions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure and Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After receiving the instructions over e-mail, participants were instructed to respond to the study when no other people were around in order to minimize distractions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> one-sided focus, <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> two-sided focus, or neutral <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong>. There were 15 participants in each of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> conditions and 16 participants in the neutral <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em><strong data-auto="strong_text">Mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> manipulation</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The procedure used in Experiment 1 to activate an <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> was applied in the current experiment. For participants assigned to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> one-sided focus condition, after they read the sample letter they listed three reasons why it could be desirable and easy to give advice on their chosen romantic area. Note that this one-sided evaluative focus resembles the type of biased processing that has been shown to naturally occur once people enter into the postdecisional phase of goal pursuit (e.g. Taylor &amp; Gollwitzer, 1995). For participants assigned to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> two-sided focus condition, after they read the sample letter they listed three reasons why it could be desirable and easy to give advice on their chosen area and three reasons why it could be undesirable and difficult to give advice on their chosen area. After listing their reasons, participants in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> conditions responded to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> questionnaire. The procedures used in Experiments 3 and 4 to activate a neutral <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> were applied in the current experiment. <sup/> After participants in the neutral <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> condition described seven things that they normally did during a typical day, they responded to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> questionnaire.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Dependent measure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">At the beginning of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> questionnaire, participants were asked to indicate their reaction toward a topic that was supposedly being debated within the United States—whether the list of convicted sex offenders should be made available to the general public rather than just the police. Specifically, participants read the following:
<blockquote>Should the list of convicted sex offenders be made available to the general public rather than just the police? On the one hand, people believe that making the registered sex offender list known to the general public rather than just the police would help citizens decide on where they want to live and where to keep children from playing unsupervised, thereby lowering the incident of future offenses. On the other hand, people believe that making the registered sex offender list known to the general public rather than just the police would make it so difficult for offenders to find a place to live and work that it would lead offenders to avoid registering as a sex offender in the first place, thereby increasing the incident of future offenses.</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In order to reduce the likelihood that participants already held a strong <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> toward this issue, we excluded 1 participant from the analyses who reported having direct contact with a sex offender in her neighborhood.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We assessed how ambivalent people were toward the issue using the following 7-point rating scales: “I have strong mixed emotions both for and against making the list of convicted sex offenders available to the general public rather than just the police” (reverse scored) and “I do not find myself feeling torn between the two sides of the issue of making the list of convicted sex offenders available to the general public rather than just the police,” on scales ranged from −3 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 3 (<em>strongly agree</em>). Participants were also asked “To what extent are you indecisive when it comes to making the list of convicted sex offenders available to the general public rather than just the police?” That scale ranged from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 7 (<em>very much</em>). These items were adopted from previous ambivalence studies (Newby-Clark, McGregor, &amp; Zanna, 2001; Priester &amp; Petty, 1996). After recoding the scale for the last item to range from −3 to 3, we created an index of ambivalence by averaging responses to the three items (α = .93). We also assessed how certain people were about their <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> toward the issue using the following 7-point rating scale: “How certain are you about your <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> toward making the list of convicted sex offenders available to the general public rather than just the police?” The scale ranged from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 7 (<em>very much</em>). As expected, certainty scores were significantly negatively correlated with ambivalence scores (<em>r</em> = −.69). Finally, participants' demographics were assessed.</p>
