<span class="medium-bold"><h3>General Method</h3></span><br/> <h4>Observers</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Seventy-two naïve subjects (16 in Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4a; 8 in Experiment 4b), all with normal or corrected-to-normal acuity and color vision, participated for course credit or monetary compensation.</span></p> <h4>Apparatus and Stimuli</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Stimuli were presented with custom software written with the VisionShell graphics libraries (Comtois, 2004) on Apple desktop computers. </span><span class="sentence">Observers sat approximately 46 cm from the monitor without head restraint. </span><span class="sentence">Displays were constructed from a set of 12 nonsense shapes used previously in studies of VSL (Figure 1b; e.g., Fiser &amp; Aslin, 2001). </span><span class="sentence">Each shape appeared in one or more of 13 colors (including black; see Figure 1c), and subtended roughly 3.3°. </span><span class="sentence">Each sequence began with the object located in the center of the display, where it immediately began moving to either the left or right at 11.48°/s. </span><span class="sentence">When the center of the object was 12.76° from the display border, the object immediately reversed direction and moved toward the same point on the opposite side of the screen. </span><span class="sentence">The object then continued back toward the center of the display, at which time the entire movement could be repeated. </span><span class="sentence">A stationary gray occluder, subtending 9.51° × 5.68°, was always present in the center of the display. </span><span class="sentence">The object was (at least partially) visible for 1 s between each moment of complete occlusion (see Figure 1a).</span></p> <h4>Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Familiarization phase</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Observers watched a 5-minute sequence of 288 colored shapes, presented as described above. </span><span class="sentence">Although the sequence of colors varied across experiments, the sequence of shapes was always identically structured. </span><span class="sentence">Each shape was assigned to a unique position in one of four triplets—sequences of three shapes that always appeared in the same order (e.g., ABC, GHI, etc.). Each third of the full shape sequence was generated by randomly interleaving 8 repetitions of each triplet with two constraints (for a total of 24 repetitions/triplet): (a) no triplet could be repeated sequentially (e.g., ABCABC), and (b) no pair of triplets could be immediately repeated (e.g., ABCGHIABCGHI). </span><span class="sentence">As a result, the joint probability of a triplet (e.g., ABC) was 0.083, while the joint probability of a sequence of three shapes spanning triplets (e.g., CGH) was 0.027.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Test phase</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After the familiarization phase, observers completed 32 two-interval forced-choice test trials, judging the relative familiarity of (a) triplets versus (b) foil sequences of three familiar shapes that had never appeared sequentially during familiarization.  The triplet and foil sequences were presented on each trial in the same disoccluding–occluding manner as during familiarization, separated by a 1-second pause, and were randomly chosen with equal likelihood; the presentation order of the alternatives was randomized. </span><span class="sentence">Observers pressed a key if the first sequence seemed more familiar and a different key if the second sequence seemed more familiar.</span></p>
