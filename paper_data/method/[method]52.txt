<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Experiment 1</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This experiment aims to test the memory decay hypothesis by eliminating differences in retention intervals across conditions. </span><span class="sentence">If the retro-cue benefit remains, then the decay hypothesis can be largely ruled out. </span><span class="sentence">Our experiment is unique in several respects. </span><span class="sentence">First, participants completed the task under articulatory suppression. </span><span class="sentence">On each trial they quickly rehearsed a prespecified word out loud to reduce verbal recoding (Baddeley, 1986). </span><span class="sentence">Second, we tried to equate the duration of memory retention by keeping constant the interval between the initial encoding and the memory refreshing. </span><span class="sentence">In the retro-cue condition, after an initial memory array and a blank retention interval of 1 s, a central arrow cue was presented for 100 ms, pointing to the location of a memory item that might later change. </span><span class="sentence">Assuming that participants started to refresh their VWM of the target item upon the onset of the cue, the effective memory retention interval would be 1,000 ms. </span><span class="sentence">The probe array was further delayed by 400 ms, such that the interstimulus interval (ISI) between memory and probe arrays was 1,500 ms. </span><span class="sentence">In the simultaneous-cue condition, after the initial memory array and a blank retention interval of 1 s, the probe array along with a central arrow cue was presented, pointing to the critical item that might change. </span><span class="sentence">The effective retention interval was also 1,000 ms, but the ISI between memory and probe arrays was 500 ms shorter than in the retro-cue condition, so any advantage in the retro-cue condition cannot be accounted for by differences in retention interval. </span><span class="sentence">Finally, in the no-cue condition, the trial sequence was the same as in the simultaneous-cue condition except that the central arrow was absent. </span><span class="sentence">Figure 2 illustrates a schematic trial sequence used in the three different conditions. </span><span class="sentence">Note that the no-cue condition was essentially a whole-report procedure, whereas the other two conditions were both partial-report procedures, with the retro-cue condition being similar to Landman et al.'s (2003) method.</span><br/><br/> <span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-2-369-fig2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-369-fig2a.gif"/><em>Figure 2. The time course of the three conditions tested in Experiment 1's expanded conditions. The probe array contained six colors or four shapes placed equidistantly on an imaginary circle whose radius was either the same as the memory array (overlapped conditions) or 1.5 times greater than the memory array (expanded conditions, shown here). Participants were told to remember the initial memory array and judge whether items on the probe array were the same as or different from items on the memory array. On simultaneous-cue and retro-cue trials, only the item cued by the central arrow could change.</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Experiment 1 went beyond a simple replication of a retro-cue benefit. </span><span class="sentence">We also tested whether the effect was seen when the memory and probe arrays did not overlap in screen locations (Griffin &amp; Nobre 2003; Lepsien et al., 2005). </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, items on the probe array might occupy the same screen locations as items on the memory display, or they might occupy locations that were 1.5 times expanded toward the periphery. </span><span class="sentence">As noted in the introduction, one explanation of the retro-cue benefit can be found in the probe interference account, which states that VWM is vulnerable to interference from subsequent visual input unless attention has already focused on the critical memory. </span><span class="sentence">This account does not specify whether or not interference from the probe array is screen based. </span><span class="sentence">If it is, expanding the probe array should reduce interference on VWM, and consequently the no-cue and simultaneous-cue performance should improve to match that of the retro-cue.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Finally, Experiment 1 tested both color VWM and shape VWM to ensure that the same pattern of results holds for different memory tasks. </span><span class="sentence">Because VWM for color is typically better than VWM for shape (Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh, 2004; Eng, Chen, &amp; Jiang, 2005), we used different memory loads for the two tasks (six colors and four shapes).</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants tested in this study were volunteers from Harvard University and its community. </span><span class="sentence">They provided informed consent and received one course credit or $10/hr. </span><span class="sentence">All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal color vision. </span><span class="sentence">They ranged from 18 to 31 years old. </span><span class="sentence">There were 18 participants in Experiment 1.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Equipment</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were tested individually in a room with normal interior lighting. </span><span class="sentence">They sat approximately 57 cm away from a 19″ computer monitor. </span><span class="sentence">The experiment was programmed with psychophysical toolbox software (Brainard, 1997;
