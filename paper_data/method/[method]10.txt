<h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All participants were native English speakers and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> categorization task was completed by 17 participants, and the lexical decision task was completed by 44 participants (22 participants randomly assigned to each half of the words). All participants were undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut who received course credit for participating.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The critical stimuli were the 532 unique orthographic forms in the McRae et al. (2005) feature norm database. These items were chosen to present the strongest test of feature-based representations. For the lexical decision test, 532 pronounceable nonwords were created that were matched in length to the words, and the items were divided into two lists of 532 items each (266 words, 266 nonwords) to keep the overall number of trials per participant equal for the two tasks and avoid fatigue effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Stimuli were presented visually in 18-point black Courier font on a white computer screen background using E-Prime software (<strong data-auto="strong_text">Psychology</strong> Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). We used a 17 in. (43.18 cm) cathode ray tube monitor with a refresh rate of 100 Hz and a resolution set to 800 Ã— 600 pixels. Each trial began with a central fixation cross on screen for 1 s, then the stimulus was presented centered horizontally and vertically and remained on screen until the participant responded (or until 5 s had elapsed). Each participant completed either the lexical decision version of the experiment or the <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> categorization version. These tasks were chosen to examine basic word-recognition accuracy and latency in one task that requires <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> access (<strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> categorization) and one task that, in principle, does not (lexical decision). The experiment was completed in one session lasting approximately 20 min. Before beginning the critical block, participants completed a 20-trial practice session. In the lexical decision task, participants were asked to indicate whether each item was a word; in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> categorization task, the participants were asked to indicate whether each word referred to a living thing or a nonliving thing.</p>
