<h3>Experiment 8: Connectedness Goals Amplify Self-Protection Concerns</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">If the risk regulation system is functional, its operation should also be sensitive to the magnitude of the conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals. </span><span class="sentence">Stronger desires to approach the partner should increase concerns about rejection (because rejection hurts more in the context of greater need). </span><span class="sentence">Activating approach goals should intensify the pressure to self-protect and reduce risk (Epstein, 1982). </span><span class="sentence">This should be especially true for people prone to self-protect, such as those low in self-esteem. </span><span class="sentence">They should become all the more resistant to dependence in situations where the desire to approach makes a partner's rejection of greater concern. </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 8, we manipulated both the strength of approach goals and the severity of the dating partner's criticism. </span><span class="sentence">We then measured the willingness to increase interdependence by seeking and providing support within the relationship. </span><span class="sentence">We hoped to further replicate the opposite and ironic effect that approach goals have on the behavior of lows. </span><span class="sentence">That is, we expected a partner's criticisms to sting all the more when approach goals were activated, motivating low self-esteem people to distance themselves from support situations.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Ninety-one couples currently involved in exclusive dating relationships participated in exchange for course credit or tickets for a lottery drawing. </span><span class="sentence">The target participants averaged 19.4 years in age (<em>SD</em> = 1.7), and their relationships averaged 15.4 months in length (<em>SD</em> = 15.6).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On arriving at the laboratory, participants learned that the study examined various aspects of their experiences in their dating relationships. </span><span class="sentence">Each member of the couple was then seated individually at one of two laboratory tables, arranged so that participants had their backs to their partners. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter then told participants that both members of the couple would be completing identical sets of questionnaires and that they would proceed from one questionnaire to the next when both members of the couple had finished. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter also reminded participants not to speak to one another as the study progressed. </span><span class="sentence">Participants then completed a questionnaire that contained demographic questions and the Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Next, target participants in the <em>partner criticism</em> experimental condition were led to believe that their partner was spending an excessive amount of time listing qualities in the target that their partner disliked (Murray et al., 2002, Experiment 3). </span><span class="sentence">To achieve this end, the target participants received a one-page questionnaire that asked them to list important aspects of their partner's character that they disliked. </span><span class="sentence">The instructions also stated that participants should not list any more than one such quality if that was all that easily came to mind. </span><span class="sentence">Target participants were led to believe that their partners received the identical questionnaire. </span><span class="sentence">However, the partners actually received a one-page questionnaire asking them to list as many of the items in their residence as they could. </span><span class="sentence">Through this subterfuge, target participants spent a few (anxious) minutes waiting for their partners to finish this task. (The experimenter stopped the partner 5 min after the target participant finished if the partner had not yet finished). </span><span class="sentence">In the control condition, targets and partner participants both received the one-page questionnaire that asked them to list important aspects of their partner's character that they disliked. </span><span class="sentence">As a result, control target participants finished the task at the same time as their partners (and had no reason to believe their partners perceived an inordinate number of faults).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experimenter then introduced the implicit approach–avoidance prime utilized in Experiment 4 under the guise of needing pilot data for a cognitive psychology study. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in the <em>approach goals</em> condition sorted words that fell into the categories of approaching a desired state, cooking, and child care. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in the <em>avoidance goals</em> condition sorted words that fell into the categories of avoiding a feared state, cooking, and child care.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">All participants then completed a questionnaire that contained the dependent measures among filler items. </span><span class="sentence">Participants completed measures tapping connectedness goals (α = .88), self-protection goals (α = .86), perceptions of the partner's disregard, willingness to provide support to the partner, willingness to seek support from the partner, and state self-esteem.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">At this point in the experiment, the experimenter then asked participants to help with a further study. </span><span class="sentence">Under this subterfuge, we obtained an objective measure of people's willingness to provide support to the partner. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter explained that one member of the couple would be asked to give a speech about the challenges facing undergraduates that would be videotaped for the office of the dean. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter then asked the partner to pick a slip of paper from a cup to see who would give the speech. </span><span class="sentence">This slip always identified the partner. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter then took the partner to another room, informed him or her that he or she would not be giving a speech, and asked the partner to write a note to the participant stating, “I'm really nervous. </span><span class="sentence">Do you think I can do this.” </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter then took the note back to the target participant and asked the target if he or she wanted to write a note in response (87.9% of participants wrote a return note). </span><span class="sentence">Participants then completed the manipulation check. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter then probed for suspicion and conducted a process debriefing.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Perceptions of partner's disregard</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This 12-item scale (α = .91), adapted from Goldsmith, McDermott, and Alexander (2000), asked participants to describe their partner's perception of them on 7-point bipolar trait scales (e.g., <em>helpful… hurtful, selfish… generous, encouraging… discouraging, considerate… inconsiderate</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Responses were scored such that higher overall scores reflected more negative perceived partner evaluations, reflecting greater hurt and internalization of the partner's criticism.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Willingness to provide support</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This 15-item scale (α = .96), adapted from Zimet, Dehlem, Zimet, and Farley (1988), tapped people's future intention to provide their partner with emotional support and assistance (e.g., “help my partner when he/she is in need,” “be a real source of comfort to my partner,” “be someone my partner can count on when things go wrong,” “help my partner make decisions,” “help my partner carry out a difficult assignment”). </span><span class="sentence">Participants responded on 9-point scales (1 = <em>not at all true</em>, 9 = <em>completely true</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Higher scores reflected greater support provision.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Willingness to seek support</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This five-item scale (α = .90) assessed how much participants relied on their partners for socioemotional support (e.g., “To what extent can you turn to your partner for advice about problems?”; “To what extent can you count on your partner to distract you from worries when you feel under stress?”). </span><span class="sentence">Participants responded on 7-point scales (1 = <em>not at all/never</em>, 7 = <em>very much/always</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Higher scores reflected greater willingness to seek support.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>State self-esteem</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This 21-item bipolar scale (α = .94) tapped people's current feelings about themselves (1 = <em>good</em>, 7 = <em>bad</em> (reverse-scored), <em>accepted… rejected</em> (reverse-scored), <em>ashamed… proud, worthless… valuable</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Higher scores indicated higher state self-esteem.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Manipulation check</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This question asked target experimental and control participants to indicate how many faults they believed their partner had listed.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Coding of Support Note</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Two undergraduate coders coded the support note on three focal dimensions (i.e., “Did the participant state the partner was overreacting?” [1 = no, 0 = yes]; “Did the participant offer the partner encouragement?” [1 = yes, 0 = no]; “How supportive do you think the note is?” [1 = <em>not at all</em>, 5 = <em>very</em>]). </span><span class="sentence">Percentage agreement in coding the categorical dimensions was 68.3% and 84.1%, and interrater reliability for the overall support ratings was .72. </span><span class="sentence">We first averaged the coder ratings and then transformed these ratings to a <em>z</em> score before creating the support index (α = .51).</span></p>
