<h3>Experiment 8: Connectedness Goals Amplify Self-Protection Concerns</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If the risk regulation system is functional, its operation should also be sensitive to the magnitude of the conflict between <strong data-auto="strong_text">connectedness</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">protection</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong>. Stronger desires to approach the partner should increase concerns about rejection (because rejection hurts more in the context of greater need). Activating approach <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> should intensify the pressure to <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-protect and reduce risk (Epstein, 1982). This should be especially true for people prone to <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-protect, such as those low in <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem. They should become all the more resistant to dependence in situations where the desire to approach makes a partner's rejection of greater concern. In Experiment 8, we manipulated both the strength of approach <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> and the severity of the dating partner's criticism. We then measured the willingness to increase interdependence by seeking and providing support within the <strong data-auto="strong_text">relationship</strong>. We hoped to further replicate the opposite and ironic effect that approach <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> have on the behavior of lows. That is, we expected a partner's criticisms to sting all the more when approach <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> were activated, motivating low <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem people to distance themselves from support situations.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Ninety-one couples currently involved in exclusive dating <strong data-auto="strong_text">relationships</strong> participated in exchange for course credit or tickets for a lottery drawing. The target participants averaged 19.4 years in age (<em>SD</em> = 1.7), and their <strong data-auto="strong_text">relationships</strong> averaged 15.4 months in length (<em>SD</em> = 15.6).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">On arriving at the laboratory, participants learned that the study examined various aspects of their experiences in their dating <strong data-auto="strong_text">relationships</strong>. Each member of the couple was then seated individually at one of two laboratory tables, arranged so that participants had their backs to their partners. The experimenter then told participants that both members of the couple would be completing identical sets of questionnaires and that they would proceed from one questionnaire to the next when both members of the couple had finished. The experimenter also reminded participants not to speak to one another as the study progressed. Participants then completed a questionnaire that contained demographic questions and the Rosenberg (1965) <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem scale.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, target participants in the <em>partner criticism</em> experimental condition were led to believe that their partner was spending an excessive amount of time listing qualities in the target that their partner disliked (Murray et al., 2002, Experiment 3). To achieve this end, the target participants received a one-page questionnaire that asked them to list important aspects of their partner's character that they disliked. The instructions also stated that participants should not list any more than one such quality if that was all that easily came to mind. Target participants were led to believe that their partners received the identical questionnaire. However, the partners actually received a one-page questionnaire asking them to list as many of the items in their residence as they could. Through this subterfuge, target participants spent a few (anxious) minutes waiting for their partners to finish this task. (The experimenter stopped the partner 5 min after the target participant finished if the partner had not yet finished). In the control condition, targets and partner participants both received the one-page questionnaire that asked them to list important aspects of their partner's character that they disliked. As a result, control target participants finished the task at the same time as their partners (and had no reason to believe their partners perceived an inordinate number of faults).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experimenter then introduced the implicit approach–avoidance prime utilized in Experiment 4 under the guise of needing pilot data for a cognitive <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> study. Participants in the <em>approach <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong></em> condition sorted words that fell into the categories of approaching a desired state, cooking, and child care. Participants in the <em>avoidance <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong></em> condition sorted words that fell into the categories of avoiding a feared state, cooking, and child care.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All participants then completed a questionnaire that contained the dependent measures among filler items. Participants completed measures tapping <strong data-auto="strong_text">connectedness</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> (α = .88), <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">protection</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> (α = .86), perceptions of the partner's disregard, willingness to provide support to the partner, willingness to seek support from the partner, and state <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">At this point in the experiment, the experimenter then asked participants to help with a further study. Under this subterfuge, we obtained an objective measure of people's willingness to provide support to the partner. The experimenter explained that one member of the couple would be asked to give a speech about the challenges facing undergraduates that would be videotaped for the office of the dean. The experimenter then asked the partner to pick a slip of paper from a cup to see who would give the speech. This slip always identified the partner. The experimenter then took the partner to another room, informed him or her that he or she would not be giving a speech, and asked the partner to write a note to the participant stating, “I'm really nervous. Do you think I can do this?” The experimenter then took the note back to the target participant and asked the target if he or she wanted to write a note in response (87.9% of participants wrote a return note). Participants then completed the manipulation check. The experimenter then probed for suspicion and conducted a process debriefing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Perceptions of partner's disregard</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This 12-item scale (α = .91), adapted from Goldsmith, McDermott, and Alexander (2000), asked participants to describe their partner's perception of them on 7-point bipolar trait scales (e.g., <em>helpful… hurtful, selfish… generous, encouraging… discouraging, considerate… inconsiderate</em>). Responses were scored such that higher overall scores reflected more negative perceived partner evaluations, reflecting greater hurt and internalization of the partner's criticism.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Willingness to provide support</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This 15-item scale (α = .96), adapted from Zimet, Dehlem, Zimet, and Farley (1988), tapped people's future intention to provide their partner with emotional support and assistance (e.g., “help my partner when he/she is in need,” “be a real source of comfort to my partner,” “be someone my partner can count on when things go wrong,” “help my partner make decisions,” “help my partner carry out a difficult assignment”). Participants responded on 9-point scales (1 = <em>not at all true</em>, 9 = <em>completely true</em>). Higher scores reflected greater support provision.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Willingness to seek support</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This five-item scale (α = .90) assessed how much participants relied on their partners for socioemotional support (e.g., “To what extent can you turn to your partner for advice about problems?”; “To what extent can you count on your partner to distract you from worries when you feel under stress?”). Participants responded on 7-point scales (1 = <em>not at all/never</em>, 7 = <em>very much/always</em>). Higher scores reflected greater willingness to seek support.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>State <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This 21-item bipolar scale (α = .94) tapped people's current feelings about themselves (1 = <em>good</em>, 7 = <em>bad</em> (reverse-scored), <em>accepted… rejected</em> (reverse-scored), <em>ashamed… proud, worthless… valuable</em>). Higher scores indicated higher state <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Manipulation check</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This question asked target experimental and control participants to indicate how many faults they believed their partner had listed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Coding of Support Note</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Two undergraduate coders coded the support note on three focal dimensions (i.e., “Did the participant state the partner was overreacting?” [1 = no, 0 = yes]; “Did the participant offer the partner encouragement?” [1 = yes, 0 = no]; “How supportive do you think the note is?” [1 = <em>not at all</em>, 5 = <em>very</em>]). Percentage agreement in coding the categorical dimensions was 68.3% and 84.1%, and interrater reliability for the overall support ratings was .72. We first averaged the coder ratings and then transformed these ratings to a <em>z</em> score before creating the support index (α = .51).</p>
