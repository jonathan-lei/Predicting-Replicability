<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Study 3</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that pride recognition generalizes across perceivers of vastly different cultures and, as was shown in Study 2, this effect is unlikely to result from cross-cultural transmission. </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, other research has found that the recognizable pride expression is spontaneously displayed by individuals across highly divergent cultures in response to success (Tracy &amp; Matsumoto, 2007). </span><span class="sentence">In this study, individuals from 36 nations, representing three distinct culture groups, were shown to display the pride expression in response to the same pride-eliciting event—winning a judo match in the Olympic Games; this finding held within all three cultures. </span><span class="sentence">As a result, the primary remaining question regarding the cross-cultural generalizability of the pride expression is whether recognition generalizes across targets of different cultures or, given that culture is not readily perceived by simply observing targets, different ethnicities. </span><span class="sentence">Can observers identify the pride expression in others, regardless of those others' ethnicity and gender? </span><span class="sentence">Does target ethnicity or gender influence the level of pride recognition? </span><span class="sentence">Study 3 addresses these questions.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We had several hypotheses for this study. </span><span class="sentence">First, according to the universality hypothesis, if the pride expression is a universal part of human nature that functions to send an adaptive signal, then it should be recognized when shown by all humans of both genders and all ethnicities. </span><span class="sentence">In fact, this seems to be the case for the basic emotions: Studies that have systematically varied target gender and ethnicity have typically found few, if any, effects on recognition (Boucher &amp; Carlson, 1980; Keltner, 1995; Massaro &amp; Ellison, 1996; Matsumoto &amp; Ekman, 1989).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Second, it is possible that pride recognition will be significantly greater than chance for all targets, supporting the universality hypothesis, but mean recognition levels will vary by target characteristics. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, according to the perceived status hypothesis, there should be meaningful differences in recognition levels for emotions that signal status when shown by targets perceived to differ in status (Keltner, 1995). </span><span class="sentence">If pride functions to convey high status, then it is likely to be displayed more frequently by high-status individuals. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, familiarity between high-status targets and pride may lead observers to have an elevated expectancy, or bias, to infer pride in individuals who are members of high-status ethnic or gender groups, regardless of the expression they are actually displaying. </span><span class="sentence">If this is the case, then we should find higher pride recognition rates and higher pride base rates (rates of using the pride label across expressions) for targets belonging to higher status groups (e.g., Caucasians and men) than for targets belonging to lower status groups (e.g., African Americans and women). </span><span class="sentence">Supporting this account, Keltner (1995) found higher recognition rates for embarrassment in African American than Caucasian targets and interpreted this finding as a result of embarrassment signaling low status combined with observers' bias toward perceiving African Americans as low status. </span><span class="sentence">Other studies support the more general idea that target ethnicity and gender can influence the way observers perceive targets' emotions, especially when emotion expressions are ambiguous or when observers have race-based biases (Hess, Adams, &amp; Kleck, 2004; Hess, Blairy, &amp; Kleck, 1997; Hugenberg &amp; Bodenhausen, 2004). </span><span class="sentence">As Macrae and Bodenhausen (2000) explained, “Activated categorical representations… provide the perceiver with expectancies that can guide the processing of subsequently encountered information… [These expectancies can] lead the perceiver to emphasize stereotype-consistent information” (p. 103).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">According to the cultural value hypothesis, pride should be more readily identified in targets belonging to ethnic groups that are stereotypically associated with pride or thought to value pride. </span><span class="sentence">For example, in the 1960s, African Americans strove to reinforce “Black pride,” and elements of the pride expression were incorporated into calls for ethnic solidarity, exemplified by the “Black Power” stance. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast, Asian Americans are typically associated with the cultural value of modesty and, in fact, have been shown to have negative views of self-esteem, self-enhancement, and pride (Eid &amp; Diener, 2001; Heine et al., 1999). </span><span class="sentence">These divergent cultural values may lead to divergent associations between each of these ethnic groups and pride, such that African Americans may be assumed to frequently experience and display pride, whereas Asian Americans may be assumed to do so only infrequently. </span><span class="sentence">If observers are aware of these presumed (or actual) cultural differences, then this may influence pride recognition rates and base rates of pride identification (i.e., false alarms) in these targets. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, the cultural value hypothesis suggests a prediction that directly competes with the perceived status hypothesis: higher pride recognition and base rates of pride identification in African American versus Asian American targets.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A potential confound to any study examining the effects of target gender or ethnicity on emotion recognition is the possibility that effects found are the result of other characteristics that vary across targets (e.g., attractiveness, facial physiognomy, etc.). Several studies have addressed this issue by including a large number of targets of each ethnicity and gender, thereby decreasing the likelihood that, on average, the targets of one ethnic–gender group will differ from the targets of another ethnic–gender group on any characteristic of relevance other than ethnicity and gender (e.g., Biehl et al., 1997). </span><span class="sentence">However, the only way to completely rule out this potential confound is to find targets that vary only in ethnicity and gender.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">For this reason, we developed a set of drawn figure targets that are identical (all are modifications of the same drawing) except for features stereotypically associated with gender and ethnicity. </span><span class="sentence">In Study 3, we first established that each drawn figure is reliably associated with the intended ethnic group and then tested whether pride recognition is influenced by target gender or ethnicity.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Eighty-three undergraduate students (65% women) from the University of California, Davis participated in exchange for course credit. </span><span class="sentence">Participants self-identified their race as Asian (50%), Caucasian (31%), Latino (10%), African American (3%), and Other or Mixed (6%).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A professional artist who specializes in drawn figures was recruited to draw human characters from the waist up showing anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, pride, sadness, and surprise. </span><span class="sentence">Nonpride emotion expressions were based on the DFA (Ekman et al., 1983), and the pride expression was based on previous research on pride (Tracy &amp; Robins, 2007a). </span><span class="sentence">The artist drew a single human character eight times, once portraying each emotion expression. </span><span class="sentence">Expressions were evaluated by a leading expert in FACS, Erika Rosenberg, and two rounds of modifications were made on the basis of her suggestions, until a final set of eight expressions were verified to include each of the movements relevant to each expression (according to EM-FACS) and no other movements. </span><span class="sentence">The artist next scanned these images to produce three copies of each target and then modified each to produce six drawn targets showing all eight expressions: three men and three women (age 20–25 years) of African, Asian, and European–Caucasian ethnic descent. </span><span class="sentence">Target gender was manipulated by changing hairstyle, hair length, and shape of chest. </span><span class="sentence">Target ethnicity was manipulated by changing the targets' skin tone (with shading; all figures were drawn in black and white), hairstyle, hair thickness, hair color, and shape and size of nose, mouth, and eyes (Blair, Judd, Sadler, &amp; Jenkins, 2002; Hugenberg &amp; Bodenhausen, 2004; Livingston &amp; Brewer, 2002).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Other than ethnic and gender characteristics, the drawn targets were identical. </span><span class="sentence">All were drawn wearing the same clothing (a white t-shirt), were the same size, and had the same basic facial physiognomy. </span><span class="sentence">Figure 5 shows three of these targets (one from each ethnic group) displaying the pride expression. </span><span class="sentence">By varying ethnicity and gender using these drawn figure targets, we ensured that any target effects found can be attributed to differences in target gender or ethnicity. </span><span class="sentence">Previous judgment studies using drawn figure targets have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method for comparing judgments of traits from body movements (e.g., Schwartz, Tesser, &amp; Powell, 1982; Spiegel &amp; Machotka, 1974).</span><br/><br/> <span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/psp-94-3-516-fig5a.gif" alt="psp-94-3-516-fig5a.gif"/><em>Figure 5.
