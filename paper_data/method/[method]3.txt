<h3>Experiment 3: So You're Angry, and You May Reject? Big Deal</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The results of Experiment 2 suggest that the participants strived to get their offers accepted and that in their “getting to yes” (cf. Fisher &amp; Ury, 1981), they strategically tried to lower the limits of especially the angry opponent. It thus seems that in the pursuit of getting one's offer accepted, people may turn to deception when confronted with anger.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The recipient's impact in the ultimatum game pertains to what would happen if he or she rejected the allocator's offers. As we noted, in the typical ultimatum <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> study, the consequences of rejection of the offer are high because rejection leaves the allocator empty handed. In such a setting, allocators may (rightfully) fear the consequences of having their offer rejected. But what would happen if the consequences of the recipient's rejection of the offer are less severe? What if outcomes can be secured even when hearing a “no?”</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As we mentioned in the introduction, it is possible to manipulate the relative power position of allocator and recipient in the ultimatum <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> context by varying the consequences of rejection. In the delta <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> game, rejection of the offer means that the offer is multiplied with a factor delta (0 ≤ delta ≤ 1). With higher values of delta, the consequences of rejection become less severe (Suleiman, 1996; Van Dijk et al., 2004). An interesting implication is that when the consequences of rejection are low, one no longer has to fear an angry recipient's reaction. Whereas it may still be true that anger communicates higher limits, the limit itself may thus become less essential in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> process. Simply put, when the consequences of rejection are low, bargainers may reason that the communication of high limits via communicated anger is not worrying at all: Why should I even care about your limits if the consequences of your rejection of my offer are low? This also means that bargainers should be less focused on having their offers accepted, and thus that in contrast to Experiments 1 and 2, we should now find effects on the perceived acceptability of the offers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In Experiment 3, we thus manipulated the consequences of rejection by manipulating delta, and again manipulated the communicated <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotions</strong> of the recipient. Our main interest was to see whether, if the consequences of rejection were low, participants would make lower offers to the angry recipient than to the happy recipient. Because fear of rejection and perceived limits have played an important role in our reasoning thus far, we also measured these constructs.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design and Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The study used a 2 (recipient's <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong>: angry vs. happy) × 2 (consequences of rejection: low vs. high) between-participants factorial design. The participants, 103 students at Leiden University (22 men and 81 women; mean age = 20.8 years), participated voluntarily.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The procedure resembled the procedures of Experiments 1 and 2, including the manipulation of recipient's <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong> (angry vs. happy). After this manipulation, all participants learned that they, X, would bargain with Y over the distribution of 100 chips; 1 chip was said to be worth .05 Euro. In all conditions, participants learned that they would make an offer to Y by indicating how they wanted the 100 chips to be allocated. If Y agreed to the division, the chips would be distributed accordingly. In the high-consequences conditions, participants learned that if the recipient turned down the division, both X and Y would not receive any money (i.e., no chips would be divided). In the low-consequences conditions, participants learned that if the recipient turned down the division, the division would be reduced by 10%. <sup/></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Subsequently, participants made their offer to the recipient. In addition to the manipulation checks and the measurement of the participant's <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong>, we also assessed the limits that participants ascribed to the recipient, the likelihood that the recipient would accept their offer, and how important it had been for them that the recipient could reject their offer. At the end of the experiment, participants were thoroughly debriefed and paid 6 Euro. All participants agreed to this procedure.</p>
