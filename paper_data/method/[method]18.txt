<h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 32 students in the last 2 years of high school, recruited from schools in Potsdam, Germany. They participated in two 1-hr sessions and were reimbursed with 12 €. They were assigned to one of two groups in alternating order.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The materials consisted of 400 one- and two-syllable German nouns. In each trial, six nouns were selected at random from this pool, with the constraint that the nouns have not been used as <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> items in any previous trial of the same block. The six selected words were assigned at random to the six serial positions. The set of six words was subdivided into two lists. For participants in the long–short group, the first four words formed the first list, and the remaining two words formed the second list. For the short–long group, the first two words formed the first list and the other four words formed the second list.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Each of the two sessions consisted of eight blocks of 32 trials each. In each trial, the six words were presented centrally one by one for 700 ms, followed by a 100-ms blank interval. The first list of two or four words (depending on group) was displayed in red, and the second list was displayed in blue on a black background. Half a second following the offset of the last word, a red or blue frame appeared centrally; its color indicated which list should be regarded as relevant. The probe appeared in the frame 100 ms later in the same color as the frame. Participants were instructed to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether the probe was contained in the relevant list. They gave their responses by pressing on the left or the right arrow key. Immediate feedback followed a key press in the form of a brief high tone for correct responses and a low tone for incorrect responses. The next trial began 1.5 s after the feedback tone.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Half the probes were positive—that is, they were contained in the relevant list; 25% were new probes not contained in any present list or in any previous <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> list of the same block; and 25% of probes were intrusion probes—that is, probes from the irrelevant list. Positive probes and intrusion probes were drawn in equal proportions from all serial positions of the relevant or the irrelevant list, respectively.</p>
