<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To address the <strong data-auto="strong_text">time</strong>–order relationship in a controlled design, in Experiment 1 (and Experiment 2) we used the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> procedure schematically depicted in Figure 1 (cf. Farrell &amp; McLaughlin, in press). Participants were presented with lists of six digits, the digits being presented with irregular timing. After presentation of the list, participants were presented with a cue indicating either (a) recall of the digits on the list in order (“NUMBERS”) or (b) recall of the timing of the digits, disregarding the identity of the digits themselves (“RHYTHM”). Use of this postcueing procedure meant that the two <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> tasks were equated both on the content of the lists and on the processing of the lists at encoding, with the only possible difference being the information recalled at output. The grouping of the lists was also manipulated by introducing grouping instructions halfway through the experiment. As reviewed earlier, instructing participants to think about list items as being in groups is sufficient to elicit grouping effects in serial recall (Ryan, 1969a). Temporal grouping was not employed, as this was thought to be a less salient grouping cue given the irregularity of list timing, and would provide a stronger test of the grouping hypothesis: If grouping affects latencies in the absence of any objective timing manipulations, we can conclude that the effects of grouping on latencies in either task are not simply due to reading of the posited temporal dimension like a tape (cf. Maybery et al., 2002).<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/b3465063919456802ac9384b40639d55/5ebcb1a7/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-1-128-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-128-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

All participants were native or fluent English speakers. Each participant completed trials in all cells of the 2 (task type: order vs. timing) × 2 (instructions: ungrouped vs. grouped) × 6 (serial position: 1–6) design.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and Apparatus</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Lists contained six digits that were randomly sampled without replacement from the 1–9 set. Sixty lists were constructed for each recall task and were subject to two constraints: (a) Following Henson (1996), lists could not contain ascending or descending pairs of integers (e.g., “3 4” or “7 6”), and (b) an item could not appear in the same serial position on consecutive lists. These constraints also applied to all remaining experiments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We varied the presentation duration of each item on each list pseudorandomly using the following procedure. First, a raw duration was generated for each item by pseudorandomly sampling from a uniform distribution with lower and upper limits of 0 and 1. The durations on each list were then scaled such that durations summed to a constant 3,000 ms; this equates to an average presentation rate of two digits per second, similar to other experiments requiring serial recall of visually presented digits (e.g., Farrell &amp; Lewandowsky, 2004). Any lists that contained a presentation duration shorter than 200 ms were entirely resampled, the resampling being repeated until the constraints were satisfied. A histogram of the resulting interstimulus intervals (ISIs) across all participants and serial positions is shown in the left panel of Figure 2.<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/d0ce4e849e9d210df44cdc3ef013f4d3/5ebcb1a7/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-1-128-fig2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-128-fig2a.gif" title="Figure 2.

Histograms of the interstimulus intervals (ISIs) across all participants and conditions for Experiment 1 (left panel) and Experiment 2 (right panel).</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We controlled the experiment with a PC that presented all stimuli (on a 15-in. [38.1 cm] monitor), and we collected and scored all responses using the Psychophysics Toolbox for MATLAB (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997). The same apparatus was used in the remaining experiments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were tested individually in a laboratory. Each trial began with a fixation point (a cross) being presented in the center of the screen for 1,000 ms. This was followed by a blank screen with a duration of 500 ms, which was then followed by presentation of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> list. List items were presented one by one on the screen, each item after the first immediately replacing the preceding item and being presented for the <strong data-auto="strong_text">time</strong> determined by the pseudorandom sampling procedure described above. Following presentation of the list, there was another blank screen of 500 ms, followed by presentation of one of the two cues “NUMBERS” and “RHYTHM.” If “NUMBERS” appeared on the screen, the participant's task was to recall the digits from the list in the order they were presented by typing them on the numeric keypad of the keyboard (i.e., standard serial recall). If the “RHYTHM” cue appeared, the participants were instructed to ignore the identity of the digits, and instead to tap the “5” key on the numeric keypad in <strong data-auto="strong_text">time</strong> with the remembered timing of the input list; that is, they should tap the key at the remembered onset of each item. In effect, the timing task required participants to reproduce the remembered durations of the items on the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> list in order. Demonstration trials were given to show exactly what was required of the participants in the timing task. The task cue remained on the screen throughout the recall period. When the participant had pressed six keys on the keypad, the cue was replaced by a blank screen for 1,000 ms before moving on to the next trial.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For the first half of the experiment (60 lists: 30 order recalls and 30 timing recalls), the participants carried out the experiment in line with the procedure as detailed. At the halfway point a message appeared on the screen with additional instructions. These instructions were to “think about the six numbers on each list as being in two groups of 3”; participants were given an example of such a grouping (“For example, if you got the list of numbers `1 7 4 8 3 2,' you would remember `1 7 4' as one group, and `8 3 2' as another group”). The <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> task was otherwise unchanged. The grouping instruction was presented in the second half of the experiment for all participants. Although this leads to an order confound, this constant ordering of conditions was chosen because the grouping strategy was otherwise expected to continue after people had been presented with grouped lists and thus contaminate the ungrouped condition (Farrell &amp; Lewandowsky, 2004; Henson, 1999).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Four practice trials were presented before the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> session began (two order trials and two timing trials) to familiarize participants with the experiment. A self-paced break was presented after every 10 <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trials; participants were presented with a message indicating that they should press the space bar to move to the next set of trials. The entire procedure lasted for around 40 min.</p>
