<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">To address the time–order relationship in a controlled design, in Experiment 1 (and Experiment 2) we used the experimental procedure schematically depicted in Figure 1 (cf. Farrell &amp; McLaughlin, in press). </button><button class="sentence">Participants were presented with lists of six digits, the digits being presented with irregular timing. </button><button class="sentence">After presentation of the list, participants were presented with a cue indicating either (a) recall of the digits on the list in order (“NUMBERS”) or (b) recall of the timing of the digits, disregarding the identity of the digits themselves (“RHYTHM”). </button><button class="sentence">Use of this postcueing procedure meant that the two memory tasks were equated both on the content of the lists and on the processing of the lists at encoding, with the only possible difference being the information recalled at output. </button><button class="sentence">The grouping of the lists was also manipulated by introducing grouping instructions halfway through the experiment. </button><button class="sentence">As reviewed earlier, instructing participants to think about list items as being in groups is sufficient to elicit grouping effects in serial recall (Ryan, 1969a). </button><button class="sentence">Temporal grouping was not employed, as this was thought to be a less salient grouping cue given the irregularity of list timing, and would provide a stronger test of the grouping hypothesis: If grouping affects latencies in the absence of any objective timing manipulations, we can conclude that the effects of grouping on latencies in either task are not simply due to reading of the posited temporal dimension like a tape (cf. Maybery et al., 2002).</button><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-1-128-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-128-fig1a.gif"/><em>Figure 1.

The durations on each list were then scaled such that durations summed to a constant 3,000 ms; this equates to an average presentation rate of two digits per second, similar to other experiments requiring serial recall of visually presented digits (e.g., Farrell &amp; Lewandowsky, 2004). </button><button class="sentence">Any lists that contained a presentation duration shorter than 200 ms were entirely resampled, the resampling being repeated until the constraints were satisfied. </button><button class="sentence">A histogram of the resulting interstimulus intervals (ISIs) across all participants and serial positions is shown in the left panel of Figure 2.</button><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-1-128-fig2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-128-fig2a.gif"/><em>Figure 2.

[38.1 cm] monitor), and we collected and scored all responses using the Psychophysics Toolbox for MATLAB (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997). </button><button class="sentence">The same apparatus was used in the remaining experiments.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were tested individually in a laboratory. </button><button class="sentence">Each trial began with a fixation point (a cross) being presented in the center of the screen for 1,000 ms. This was followed by a blank screen with a duration of 500 ms, which was then followed by presentation of the memory list. </button><button class="sentence">List items were presented one by one on the screen, each item after the first immediately replacing the preceding item and being presented for the time determined by the pseudorandom sampling procedure described above. </button><button class="sentence">Following presentation of the list, there was another blank screen of 500 ms, followed by presentation of one of the two cues “NUMBERS” and “RHYTHM.” </button><button class="sentence">If “NUMBERS” appeared on the screen, the participant's task was to recall the digits from the list in the order they were presented by typing them on the numeric keypad of the keyboard (i.e., standard serial recall). </button><button class="sentence">If the “RHYTHM” cue appeared, the participants were instructed to ignore the identity of the digits, and instead to tap the “5” key on the numeric keypad in time with the remembered timing of the input list; that is, they should tap the key at the remembered onset of each item. </button><button class="sentence">In effect, the timing task required participants to reproduce the remembered durations of the items on the memory list in order. </button><button class="sentence">Demonstration trials were given to show exactly what was required of the participants in the timing task. </button><button class="sentence">The task cue remained on the screen throughout the recall period. </button><button class="sentence">When the participant had pressed six keys on the keypad, the cue was replaced by a blank screen for 1,000 ms before moving on to the next trial.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">For the first half of the experiment (60 lists: 30 order recalls and 30 timing recalls), the participants carried out the experiment in line with the procedure as detailed. </button><button class="sentence">At the halfway point a message appeared on the screen with additional instructions. </button><button class="sentence">These instructions were to “think about the six numbers on each list as being in two groups of 3”; participants were given an example of such a grouping (“For example, if you got the list of numbers `1 7 4 8 3 2,' you would remember `1 7 4' as one group, and `8 3 2' as another group”). </button><button class="sentence">The experimental task was otherwise unchanged. </button><button class="sentence">The grouping instruction was presented in the second half of the experiment for all participants. </button><button class="sentence">Although this leads to an order confound, this constant ordering of conditions was chosen because the grouping strategy was otherwise expected to continue after people had been presented with grouped lists and thus contaminate the ungrouped condition (Farrell &amp; Lewandowsky, 2004; Henson, 1999).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Four practice trials were presented before the experimental session began (two order trials and two timing trials) to familiarize participants with the experiment. </button><button class="sentence">A self-paced break was presented after every 10 experimental trials; participants were presented with a message indicating that they should press the space bar to move to the next set of trials. </button><button class="sentence">The entire procedure lasted for around 40 min.</button></p>
