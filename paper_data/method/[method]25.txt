<h3>Experiment 1: Testing Bound Objects</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While most previous studies have employed monochromatic shapes, this preliminary experiment verified that our method could give rise to VSL even when each shape had its own unique color during both familiarization and test, as a critical baseline for our later experiments.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Each shape was assigned a single unique nonblack color, in which it always appeared throughout the experiment (Figure 2a).<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/76d9f863186fa108e7e1ef5da417050c/5ebcb19d/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-2-399-fig2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-399-fig2a.gif" title="Figure 2.
