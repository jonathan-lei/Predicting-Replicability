<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Experiment 1</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This experiment takes as a starting point Lavis and Mitchell's (2006) demonstration of the intermixed–blocked effect using visual stimuli in humans. </span><span class="sentence">Examples of the stimuli, complex and very similar checkerboards, are presented in Figure 1. </span><span class="sentence">Using stimuli of this sort, Lavis and Mitchell showed that discrimination, as assessed by a same–different test procedure, was enhanced after preexposure, in which the stimuli were presented on an intermixed schedule (AX/BX). </span><span class="sentence">Comparison was made with the performance shown to other stimuli (CX and DX) that were preexposed in separate blocks of trials. </span><span class="sentence">In that experiment, the spacing of trials was uniform, which meant that the interval between successive presentations of AX (or of BX) was twice that separating successive presentations of CX (or of DX). </span><span class="sentence">In this experiment we repeated the AX/BX preexposure condition and also presented CX in a separate block of trials. </span><span class="sentence">In this blocked condition, stimulus presentations were massed. </span><span class="sentence">However, presentations of a second blocked stimulus, DX, were separated by an interval corresponding to one stimulus presentation. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, the spacing of DX presentations was equivalent to the spacing of AX (and BX) presentations. </span><span class="sentence">On the test trials that followed preexposure, the participants were required to discriminate each of the compound cues (AX, BX, CX, and DX) from X. We predicted that if superior performance following intermixed preexposure (AX/BX) is due to temporal spacing alone, then the DX stimulus in the spaced condition would be easily discriminated from the common X cue on test.</span><br/><br/> <span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-1-237-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-237-fig1a.gif"/><em>Figure 1.

(2) intermixed same, in which AX and AX (or BX and BX) were presented; (3) blocked different, in which CX and X were presented; (4) blocked same, in which CX and CX were presented; (5) spaced different, in which DX and X were presented; and (6) spaced same, in which DX and DX were presented. </span><span class="sentence">The order of stimulus presentation was randomized across test trials. </span><span class="sentence">Each unique feature (A–D) was presented on 12 trials in total, there being 6 different trials and 6 same trials with each.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Test trials consisted of the presentation of one stimulus for 800 ms, followed by a blank screen for 550 ms and the presentation of the second stimulus for 800 ms. </span><span class="sentence">A white square was then presented in place of the checkerboard, and it remained on the screen until the response was made.</span></p> <h4>Scoring</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A set of planned contrasts using a multivariate, repeated measures model (O'Brien &amp; Kaiser, 1985) was used to analyze the data from this and all subsequent experiments. </span><span class="sentence">A significance level of <em>p</em> &lt; .05 was set for all of the statistical analyses.</span></p>
