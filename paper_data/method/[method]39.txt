<h3>Method</h3><br/> <h4>Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Using flyers posted around campus and informational e-mails sent to the freshmen, sophomore, and junior class Listservs, we recruited 163 undergraduate students (81 women, 82 men) to participate in a study of romantic-attraction processes, including a speed-dating component (for greater procedural detail, see Finkel et al., 2007). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were 19.6 years old on average (<em>SD</em> = 1.0 years); 36.2% were freshmen, 38.7% were sophomores, 21.5% were juniors, and 3.7% were seniors. (We recruited seniors less aggressively because they were scheduled to graduate approximately 6 weeks after the events.) The sample was 73.6% White/Caucasian, 10.4% Asian, 5.5% South Asian, 4.3% Hispanic, 2.5% African American, 1.2% Middle Eastern, and 2.5% unreported.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were paid $5 at the end of the speed-dating event and $3 for every follow-up questionnaire (out of 10) completed. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, those who completed at least 9 of the 10 follow-up questionnaires were paid a bonus of $10.</span></p> <h4>Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Part 1: Pre-event questionnaire</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The first part of the study consisted of a 30-min online pre-event questionnaire assessing background variables about the participants. </span><span class="sentence">Participants completed this questionnaire 6–13 days before attending a speed-dating event.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Part 2: Speed-dating</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The second part of this study consisted of a full-fledged 2-hr speed-dating event at which participants pursued “matches” with opposite-sex participants. </span><span class="sentence">Events were modeled loosely on procedures used by professional speed-dating companies and took place in a secluded art gallery located in Northwestern University’s student union. </span><span class="sentence">Tables and chairs were positioned throughout the room such that each pair of speed-daters could communicate easily with one another while seated a comfortable distance away from other pairs. </span><span class="sentence">Nonalcoholic beverages, lighting, and music were selected to make the event elegant and were held constant across all speed-dating events.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Upon each participant’s arrival at the event, one research assistant gave him or her a name tag, clipboard, pen, a set of interaction-record questionnaires, and a unique ID (letters for women, numbers for men). </span><span class="sentence">The research assistant instructed participants to write their ID and first name on their name tag. </span><span class="sentence">Next, a second research assistant took a digital photo of the participant and was willing to take additional photos until the participant was happy with one. </span><span class="sentence">Once all participants had arrived, the experimenter explained how the speed-dating event would proceed.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">For three randomly determined speed-dating events, men remained seated while women rotated from man to man; for the remaining four speed-dating events, women remained seated while men rotated. </span><span class="sentence">Each speed-date lasted for 4 min; participants conversed freely during this time. </span><span class="sentence">After each speed-date, the experimenter blew a whistle to signal that participants should rotate to the location for their next speed-date. </span><span class="sentence">Before beginning this next speed-date, however, participants completed an interaction record about the previous date and jotted notes to themselves to take home. </span><span class="sentence">After 2 min passed, the experimenter signaled for participants to complete their interaction records and begin their next 4-min date. </span><span class="sentence">Participants dated all opposite-sex individuals present and had between 9 and 13 dates, depending on event attendance. </span><span class="sentence">Once all dates had been completed, the experimenter explained to the participants how to complete the matching process and remaining questionnaires.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After the event, participants returned to the speed-dating Web site, where they indicated whether they would be interested in meeting again each person they had speed-dated. </span><span class="sentence">Participants clicked “yes” or “no” next to the photograph and ID of each speed-dater. </span><span class="sentence">When two speed-daters replied “yes” to one another, this was called a “match”; only matches were later provided with the ability to contact one another (see below). </span><span class="sentence">Participants also indicated whether they would allow “missed matches” (speed-daters who had said “no” to the participant but to whom the participant had said “yes”) to learn that the participant had said “yes” to them. </span><span class="sentence">If the participant allowed this option, the missed match was given the option of changing his/her previous “no” response to a “yes,” thus securing an extra match for both the participant and the missed match. </span><span class="sentence">In total, 100% of participants completed the matching process, and 54% chose the missed-matches option. </span><span class="sentence">Participants generated a total of 206 matching pairs (average number of matches per participant = 2.53, <em>SD</em> = 2.0).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">At 5 p.m. the day following the speed-dating event, participants received an e-mail directing them to a Web site where they could view their matches. </span><span class="sentence">The Web site displayed the photograph, ID, and first name of each speed-dater with whom the participant had a match. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were also given the ability to change their “no” to a “yes” for any speed-daters who agreed to the missed-matches option described above. </span><span class="sentence">After completing a brief postmatch questionnaire, participants could then click on a button next to each match’s photograph to get to the speed-dating messaging page. </span><span class="sentence">Participants could use this page to send a message to a match and to view messages received from that match.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Part 3: Follow-up</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Twenty-four hr after they had access to their match information (and 48 hr after the speed-dating event), participants received an e-mail directing them to a Web site where they could complete the first of 10 follow-up questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence">They received similar e-mails every 72 hr until the follow-up portion of the study was completed (30 days after the speed-dating event). </span><span class="sentence">They were instructed to complete each questionnaire before going to bed that night, although we accepted late questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence">Of the 92% of speed-dating participants who elected to take part in the follow-up portion of the study, 69% completed at least 9 of the 10 questionnaires.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On each of the 10 follow-up questionnaires, participants responded to items about each speed-dating match. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, participants were asked to provide the name of anyone else (aside from their matches) whom they considered to be a romantic interest. </span><span class="sentence">After providing the name of this “write-in” target, they completed follow-up questions about this individual, in addition to their matches, at each wave. </span><span class="sentence">Participants could provide multiple write-in targets; altogether, participants reported on 143 write-ins over the course of the month. </span><span class="sentence">Most of the write-ins (78%) attended Northwestern University or lived in the Chicago/Evanston, Illinois area, whereas 20% were currently living or going to school elsewhere in the United States (no information was available for the remaining 2%). </span><span class="sentence">According to the participants’ reports, the write-ins were 20.1 years old on average (<em>SD</em> = 2.0 years), participants had known the write-ins for an average of 380 days (<em>Mdn</em> = 180 days), and they had been romantically interested in them for an average of 245 days (<em>Mdn</em> = 68 days). </span><span class="sentence">We refer to follow-up questionnaire targets as either a “speed-date/match” or “write-in” to reflect the two different ways a target could be included in the data set. </span><span class="sentence">Write-ins are useful because they can address whether any of the follow-up results can be explained away as strange anomalies that are only characteristic of relationships that grow out of a speed-date (see Eastwick &amp; Finkel, in press-b; Finkel et al., 2007). </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, data pertaining to write-ins are presented separately from those pertaining to speed-dating matches.</span></p> <h4>Materials</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">All measures included in the present report (except for “yessing”) were assessed on four different questionnaires: pre-event, interaction-record, postmatch, and follow-up. </span><span class="sentence">The present report focuses on the following three traits that might describe a romantic partner: <em>physically attractive</em> (assessed by the items “physically attractive” and “sexy/hot”), <em>earning prospects</em> (“good career prospects,” “ambitious/driven”), and <em>personable</em> (“fun/exciting,” “responsive,” “dependable/trustworthy,” “friendly/nice”). </span><span class="sentence">The first two constructs were examined because of their relevance to the literature on sex differences in mate preferences; the third serves as a useful comparison and includes characteristics that both men and women desire in a romantic partner (e.g., Fletcher, Simpson, Thomas, &amp; Giles, 1999; see factor analysis that follows).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stated mate preferences</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Stated mate preferences were assessed in two different ways (ideal partner and speed-date) at two different times (pre-event and Wave 10 follow up). </span><span class="sentence">First, as part of the pre-event questionnaire, participants rated the importance of physically attractive (α = .83), earning prospects (α = .75), and personable (α = .71) characteristics in an ideal romantic partner on a scale from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 9 (<em>extremely</em>). </span><span class="sentence">We refer to these reports as <em>pre-event ideal partner</em> stated preferences.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Given that the present study was inspired by the literature on ideal partner preferences, these pre-event ideal partner reports seemed the most logical measures to use for construct validation. </span><span class="sentence">We conducted a factor analysis (principal axis factoring with promax rotation) on the eight items (see above) that were intended to assess the three ideal partner constructs of interest. </span><span class="sentence">Inspection of the scree plot revealed a three-factor solution: The two items assessing Physically Attractive loaded primarily on the first factor, the four items assessing Personable loaded primarily on the second, and the two items assessing Earning Prospects loaded primarily on the third (all factor loadings &gt; .5 with no double loadings).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Of course, an ideal partner preference is context-free, and the principle of attitude–behavior compatibility (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005) suggests that such a preference would best predict behavior when it refers to the same, specific context in which the behavior will take place. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, also on the pre-event questionnaire, participants received the following instructions: “How much do you think the following characteristics will matter in your decision to ‘yes’ or ‘no’ someone after your 4-minute date.” </span><span class="sentence">Participants then responded to the identical items reported above that assessed Physically Attractive (α = .84), Earning Prospects (α = .72), and Personable (α = .44) characteristics.  We refer to these reports as <em>pre-event speed-date</em> stated preferences.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On the tenth and final follow-up questionnaire, participants again reported their ideal romantic partner preferences for Physically Attractive (α = .76), Earning Prospects (α = .79), and Personable (α = .77), just as they had on the pre-event questionnaire. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, participants reported the likelihood that Physically Attractive (α = .76), Earning Prospects (α = .73), and Personable (α = .58) characteristics would matter in their decision to “yes” or “no” someone after a 4-min date should they go speed-dating again. </span><span class="sentence">These reports are referred to as <em>Wave 10 ideal partner</em> and <em>Wave 10 speed-date</em> stated preferences, respectively.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Partner characteristics</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">As part of the interaction record, participants rated on a scale from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 9 (<em>extremely</em>) the extent to which they thought each speed-dating partner was characterized by the identical items reported above that assessed Physically Attractive (α = .95), Earning Prospects (α = .86), and Personable (α = .84) characteristics. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, on each follow-up questionnaire, participants used a 1–9 scale to rate the extent to which they thought each speed-dating match and write-in was characterized by the items assessing Physically Attractive (α = .92), Earning Prospects (α = .79), and Personable (α = .81) characteristics.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Relationship initiation dependent variables</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On a scale from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 9 (<em>strongly agree</em>), the interaction record assessed participants’ reports of <em>romantic desire</em> for the speed-dating partner (“I really liked my interaction partner,” “I was sexually attracted to my interaction partner,” and “I am likely to say ‘yes’ to my interaction partner”; α = .88) and <em>chemistry</em> with him or her (“My interaction partner and I seemed to have a lot in common,” “… seemed to have similar personalities,” and “… had a real connection”; α = .91).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">All postmatch questionnaire and follow-up questionnaire relationship-initiation dependent variables were assessed on scales from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 7 (<em>strongly agree</em>). </span><span class="sentence">As part of the postmatch questionnaire, participants indicated for each match their level of match <em>excitement</em> (“I am extremely excited that I matched with [name]”), their <em>initiation plans</em> (“I am very likely to initiate contact with [name]”), and their <em>initiation hopes</em> (“I hope that [name] initiates contact with me”).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On each of the 10 follow-up questionnaires, participants responded to items pertaining to each speed-dating match and to each write-in. </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, the items about each match/write-in were customized depending on the participants’ answer to the following pivot question: “What is the current status of your relationship with [name].” </span><span class="sentence">Participants were given the following response options to this question: (a) dating seriously, (b) dating casually, (c) friend <em>with</em> romantic potential, (d) acquaintance <em>with</em> romantic potential, (e) friend <em>without</em> romantic potential, (f) acquaintance <em>without</em> romantic potential, (g) no relationship at all. </span><span class="sentence">Participants completed the pivot question about each match/write-in every time they completed a follow-up questionnaire. </span><span class="sentence">If a participant selected option a, b, c, or d, this match/write-in was considered <em>romantic</em>, and if a participant selected option e, f, or g, this match/write-in was considered <em>nonromantic</em>. </span><span class="sentence">If a participant selected option g on two (or more) consecutive waves, no items were assessed for that match/write-in at that wave. </span><span class="sentence">A smaller subset of items was required for nonromantic compared to romantic matches/write-ins (for greater detail, see Finkel et al., 2007).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">If participants selected either a romantic or a nonromantic response to the pivot question, participants completed an item assessing to what degree this particular match/write-in was someone they wanted to <em>get to know better</em> (“I am eager to get to know [name] better”). </span><span class="sentence">In addition, if participants responded “yes” that they had “hung out with [name] in person or corresponded with [name] not in person (e-mail, instant messaging, phone, etc.)” since the last time they completed a follow-up questionnaire, they completed a one-item measure of <em>date initiation</em> (“For the most part, I was the one to initiate correspondence/hanging out with [name]”) and a one-item measure of <em>date enjoyment</em> (“Corresponding/hanging out with [name] has been enjoyable”).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">If participants selected a romantic response to the pivot question, they completed the following additional measures: a five-item measure of romantic <em>passion</em> (“I feel a great deal of sexual desire for [name],” “I think [name] and I have ‘soulmate’ potential,” “I am romantically interested in [name],” “[name] is the only person I want to be romantically involved with,” and “[name] always seems to be on my mind”; α = .84), three items assessing to what extent the participant desired a <em>one-night stand</em>, a <em>casual relationship</em>, and a <em>serious relationship</em> with the match/write-in (“I would like to have a one-night stand with [name],” “… a casual relationship with [name],” “… a serious relationship with [name]”), and an item assessing <em>commitment</em> to the match/write-in (“I am committed to pursuing/maintaining a relationship with [name]”).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Finally, if participants responded “yes” that they had “engaged in any romantic physical contact (kissing or other sexual activities) with [name]” since the last time they had completed a follow-up questionnaire, they completed a one-item measure of <em>sexual initiation</em> (“I basically initiated the physical contact with [name]”), a one-item measure of <em>sexual enjoyment</em> (“I enjoyed the romantic physical contact with [name]”), and an item assessing to what extent the physical contact was a <em>good idea</em> (“having romantic physical contact with [name] was a bad idea [reverse scored]”).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Potential moderator constructs</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the present report, we explore five moderators of H2 and H3. </span><span class="sentence">First, we describe the three constructs that were measured at the level of the individual participant (i.e., person-level moderators). </span><span class="sentence">Two of these three were intended to address H2A: Perhaps sex differences in the association between the relationship-initiation dependent variables and physical attractiveness or earning prospects will be larger for individuals who are more (compared with less) interested in acquiring a serious romantic relationship (Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad &amp; Simpson, 2000). </span><span class="sentence">The first moderator was <em>desire for a serious relationship (target-general)</em>, assessed on the pre-event questionnaire by the item: “These days, how much would you like to have a serious relationship” (1 = <em>not at all</em>, 7 = <em>very much</em>). </span><span class="sentence">The second moderator is a three-item measure of <em>sociosexuality</em>, a construct that assesses an individual’s willingness to engage in short-term sexual relationships (Simpson &amp; Gangestad, 1991). </span><span class="sentence">The three items were assessed on the pre-event questionnaire (1 = <em>strongly disagree</em>, 7 = <em>strongly agree</em>) and were selected from the original Simpson and Gangestad (1991) inventory: “Sex without love is okay,” “I would have to be closely attached to someone (both emotionally and psychologically) before I could feel comfortable and fully enjoy having sex with him or her” (reverse scored), and “I can imagine myself being comfortable and enjoying ‘casual’ sex with different partners” (α = .86). </span><span class="sentence">The third was <em>self-perceived mate value</em> and was assessed on the pre-event questionnaire (1 = <em>strongly disagree</em>, 7 = <em>strongly agree</em>) by the items “I am a desirable dating partner,” “In general, I tend to have many options for romantic partners,” and “Members of the opposite sex that I like tend to like me back” (α = .68). </span><span class="sentence">We used this construct to probe H3: Perhaps individuals are more likely to demonstrate interest in and pursue potential partners who approximate their ideals to the extent that they are high (or perhaps low) in self-perceived mate value.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the present report, we explored two additional moderators that were assessed on the follow-up questionnaire about each match/write-in classified as romantic (i.e., target-specific moderators). </span><span class="sentence">The first is <em>desire for a serious relationship (target-specific)</em>, which also serves as one of the relationship-initiation dependent variables (see above). </span><span class="sentence">The second is <em>partner-specific attachment anxiety</em>, assessed by the items “I need a lot of reassurance that [name] cares about me,” “I worry that [name] doesn’t care about me as much I care about him/her,” and “I feel uncertain about [name]’s true feelings for me” (α = .80). </span><span class="sentence">This construct represents the uncertainty and need for reassurance that individuals often experience in romantic relationships. </span><span class="sentence">Elsewhere (Eastwick &amp; Finkel, in press-a), we have explored this construct in detail and argued that it is a common experience during the early stages of a romantic relationship. </span><span class="sentence">For the purposes of the present report, we hypothesized that partner-specific attachment anxiety could foster an empathy gap (Loewenstein, 2005) between participants’ stated preferences (which they likely reported in a “cool” cognitive state) and the characteristics that actually inspire their passion for potential romantic partners. </span><span class="sentence">For simplicity, the analyses for the two target-specific moderators were conducted on the dependent variable <em>romantic attraction</em> (α = .87); this DV is an average of the seven romantic-initiation dependent variable items (the five items encompassing <em>passion</em>, the <em>get to know better</em> item, and the <em>commitment</em> item), which (a) were necessarily assessed for that match or write-in at that wave and (b) were not obviously redundant with either moderator (e.g., the <em>one-night stand</em> and <em>casual relationship</em> items).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Analysis strategy</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We used multilevel data-analytic strategies to examine the present data (Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Bolger, 1998; Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002). </span><span class="sentence">Data collected prior to the follow-up questionnaires have a two-level structure: Measures assessed about each speed-date/match (Level 1) are nested within participant (Level 2). </span><span class="sentence">Data collected on the follow-up questionnaires have a three-level structure: Measures assessed on each of the 10 follow-up questionnaires (Level 1) are nested within each match/write-in (Level 2), which are nested within participant (Level 3). </span><span class="sentence">For example, a participant who was a “friend with romantic potential” with two different matches for all 10 follow-up questionnaires would provide 20 different associations between partner characteristics and passion (10 for each match). </span><span class="sentence">All analyses were carried out in SAS with either the NLMIXED procedure (to predict “yessing” using logistic regression) or the MIXED procedure (for all remaining dependent variables). </span><span class="sentence">The intercept was permitted to vary randomly at Level 2 and Level 3 (where applicable). </span><span class="sentence">All variables were left unstandardized (unless indicated otherwise); participant sex was coded male = −.5, female = .5.</span></p>
