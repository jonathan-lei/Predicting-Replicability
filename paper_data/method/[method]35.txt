<h3>Study 4</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, we conducted a fourth study that directly tested the validity of the selection-criteria explanation by manipulating both the salience of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> direction and <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> quality as a selection criterion in the 2- and 10-<strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> conditions. If conditions with 2 versus more than 2 (e.g., 4 or 10) pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> trigger different selection criteria and thus account for different <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> preferences in the 2- versus 10-<strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> conditions, then the direct experimental manipulation of these two selection criteria (<strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> direction vs. <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> quality) should directly affect <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> search, whereas the effect of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">quantity</strong> on <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> preference should be simultaneously eliminated. This experimental logic is analogous to the logic of mediational analysis (Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986). The mediator variable (i.e., different salient selection criteria) should be connected to the dependent variable (i.e., <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> preference). That is, a direct manipulation of the mediator variable should lead to the same effect in the dependent variable as a manipulation of the independent variable (i.e., <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">quantity</strong>). In addition, if the effect of the mediator variable is statistically controlled for, the effect of the independent variable (<strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">quantity</strong>) on the dependent variable (<strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> preference) should be eliminated.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In order to provide such a test, we conducted the following experiment. As in Study 3, participants made a personnel decision about the future career of Mr. Miller and subsequently selected 1 out of either 2 or 10 pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>, half supporting and half conflicting with their prior decision. In addition, participants were instructed to base their <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> selection on either <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> direction (direction focus) or <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> quality (quality focus). A control group received no additional instructions. If an increased salience of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> direction is associated with an increased desire to appear unbiased and therefore causes a systematic preference for inconsistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>, then the direction focus should lead to a preference for inconsistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> in both the 2- and 10-<strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> conditions. In contrast, given the quality focus, a systematic preference for consistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> was expected for the 2- as well as the 10-<strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> condition due to the general expected quality advantage of consistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One hundred and fifty five (112 women and 43 men, ages ranged from 19 to 49 years; <em>M</em> = 25.25, <em>SD</em> = 5.28) students from Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany, participated in this experiment. All participants were recruited on the university campus by asking whether they would be willing to participate in a study on decision making at the nearby Department of <strong data-auto="strong_text">Psychology</strong>. The experiment was based on a 2 (<strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">quantity</strong>: 2 vs. 10) × 3 (induced selection criterion: quality focus vs. direction focus vs. no focus induction) between-subjects design. Participants were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As in Study 3, the Miller case was used. After the introduction and preliminary decision on whether the contract of the manager, Mr. Miller, should be extended or not (participants were informed that following their <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> search they could revise their preliminary decision), participants selected from 2 or 10 pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> that provided additional consistent and inconsistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> concerning their prior decision. However, in order to manipulate quality or direction salience, we had them read different instructions prior to <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> selection. The instruction for the quality focus was as follows: “Very important: please compare the available pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> with regard to their quality and select the one that is the best in your opinion, that is, the one which you consider to be most important, most credible, and most cogent. You can only select one of the available pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>.” Correspondingly, the instruction for the direction focus was as follows: “Very important: half of the following articles are in favor of an extension and half of them are against an extension of Mr. Miller’s contract. Please bear this in mind as you select a piece of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>; you should just consider whether you would like to read a piece of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> that supports your prior decision or one that contradicts it. You can only select one of the available pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>.” <sup/> Participants in the control condition received no extra focus instruction, the only instruction to them was “You can only select one of the available pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>.” Following <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> selection, participants made a final decision, which marked the end of the experiment. All participants were debriefed, informed why it was not necessary to read the selected pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>, and given a cup of coffee and a chocolate bar as a token of our thanks for participation.</p>
