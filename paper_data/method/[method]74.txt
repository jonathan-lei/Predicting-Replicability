<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Study 4: Buttressing the Self</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Study 3 suggests that moral rebels are resented by actors because of the perception that they would, if they could, reject others who do not take a similar position. </span><span class="sentence">This fits our model, which posits that the imagined rejection perceived in moral rebels is a threat to one's sense of adequacy (Hypothesis 3). </span><span class="sentence">As we have noted, the moral rebel in our studies is actually not in a position to judge participants, but we argue that the simple fact that someone could look down on them can shake participants' self-confidence, and it is this sting that triggers the rejection. </span><span class="sentence">Having shown the role of imagined reproach in Study 3, in Study 4 we proceeded to show the implication of the self. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, we reasoned that if the rejection of moral rebels indeed results from shaking participants' self-confidence, then actors should not feel a need to reject rebels if they have been secured in their sense of being a good, effective person (Prediction 3a).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Spencer et al. (2001) showed that after receiving bogus negative feedback on an intelligence test, participants chose to listen to a poorly performing peer in preparation for a later interview. </span><span class="sentence">However, when participants had had the chance to write about an important value, they preferred to listen to a highly performing peer. </span><span class="sentence">Apparently, this opportunity to self-affirm made an impressive peer more palatable, despite the recent setback of the intelligence test. </span><span class="sentence">Along similar lines, and in line with self-affirmation theory (Sherman &amp; Cohen, 2006; Steele, 1988), we predicted that buttressing participants' sense of adequacy by giving them a chance to reflect on one of their important values or qualities would shield them from the sting of imagined rejection and would therefore reduce the need to put down moral rebels (Prediction 3a).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In essence, we predicted that self-affirmed actors in Study 4 would resemble uninvolved observers in Studies 1–3. </span><span class="sentence">Prior research suggests that self-affirmation can reduce the tendency to deny or skew information that is threatening to one's beliefs, and thus reduce the impact of one's initial point of view on the processing of new information (e.g., Cohen, Aronson, &amp; Steele,2000). </span><span class="sentence">We predicted that self-affirmation would similarly give actors some distance, both reducing their need to reject the rebel (Prediction 3a, above) and allowing them to recognize the value of the rebel's behavior as a moral, agentic choice—possibly to the point of questioning their own (Prediction 3b).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A secondary goal of Study 4 was to determine whether the rejection of a moral rebel serves to reduce the kind of negative affect or psychological discomfort assumed to accompany cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957). </span><span class="sentence">We thus added measures of self-reported affect and discomfort, varying whether they were presented before or after the opportunity to put down the rebel. </span><span class="sentence">The placement of these measures could be important, because if a process serves to reduce discomfort, then discomfort should be high when measured before it but lower when measured after (cf. Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994).</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Seventy-nine undergraduates at a large U.S. private university (47 Whites, 17 Asians, 9 Hispanics, 3 Native Americans, 2 non-Black multiracial, and 1 Iranian; 52 men, 27 women) came to the laboratory to complete the research participation requirement of an introductory psychology class or in exchange of a payment of $8. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter was a White man.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: obedient, rebel control, or rebel self-affirmation. </span><span class="sentence">All participants in this study were actors (i.e., completed the police decision task first) and saw a compliant other in the first condition, or a rebel other in the other two. </span><span class="sentence">Before rating the other, participants wrote a personal essay in the self-affirmation condition or listed foods in the rebel control and obedient conditions. </span><span class="sentence">We also included two different orders within the rebel control condition to look at a possible order effect on affect measures (cf. Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994), but we collapsed these two conditions into one for simplicity after discovering that this order made no difference (see the <em>Placement of affect measures</em> section).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants came to the laboratory to take part in a decision-making study and were told that they would make decisions, form impressions of other students, and fill out some mood and emotion questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence">They first completed the police decision task from Study 3. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter, sitting with his back toward participants for the duration of the study, then came by with a clipboard and ostensibly made a note of the participant's choice in the task. </span><span class="sentence">After this, participants wrote a personal essay or listed foods they had eaten (see below). </span><span class="sentence">After 8 min, the experimenter told participants that they would switch to forming impressions of a past participant and gave them a blank rating sheet and a completed version of the police decision task (containing the rebel vs. obedient manipulation) ostensibly taken randomly from a stack of completed questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence">The other participant was always White, age 19, and matched in gender with the participants. </span><span class="sentence">Participants' own completed decision task was left on the table, face up, next to the one allegedly completed by the other student—and it was left there until the end of the study to make sure it remained salient to participants. </span><span class="sentence">After indicating their impression of the other participant, participants rated their affective state on a list of traits (half the participants in the rebel control condition did this first) and answered the questions about the situation and about expected rejection introduced in Study 3.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Self-Affirmation Manipulation</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the rebel self-affirmation condition, participants read the following instructions:</p><blockquote><span class="sentence">Please write about a recent experience in which you demonstrated a quality or value that is very important to you and which made you feel good about yourself. </span><span class="sentence">Examples of “personally important values or quality” might include (but are not limited to) artistic skills, sense of humor, social skills, spontaneity, athletic ability, musical talent, physical attractiveness, creativity, business skills, or romantic values.</span></blockquote><span class="sentence"> Participants named their chosen quality or value, rated its personal importance on a scale from 0 ( <em>not important at all</em>) to 4 ( <em>extremely important</em>), then described their experience on the blank lines provided on the rest of the page in the remaining 8 min. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in the obedient or rebel control conditions instead read the following instructions: “Please describe everything you have eaten or drunk in the past 48 hours. </span><span class="sentence">Do not worry about things you find yourself unable to remember,” followed by blank lines on the rest of the page.</span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Ratings were similar to previous studies, with some small changes. </span><span class="sentence">Participants indicated how much they would like to work on a project with the other participant and how much they would like him or her as a friend, both on an 11-point scale ranging from −5 ( <em>dislike very much</em>) to + 5 ( <em>like very much</em>), with an unlabeled midpoint of 0. </span><span class="sentence">They indicated how much they respected the other participant on a similar 11-point scale ranging from −5 ( <em>despise a great deal</em>) to +5 ( <em>respect a great deal</em>), then indicated the personality trait that they thought best described the other participant (open ended), and finally rated the other participant on the 14 semantic differentials on 7-point scales with a midpoint of 0 ( <em>neither</em>) and with the following poles: <em>stupid–intelligent</em>, <em>strong–weak</em>, <em>unpleasant–pleasant</em>, <em>funny–not funny</em>, <em>confident–insecure, immature–mature</em>, <em>active–passive</em>, <em>cruel–kind</em>, <em>nice–awful</em>, <em>cold–warm, honest–dishonest</em>, <em>unfair–fair</em>, <em>moral–immoral</em>, and <em>dependent–independent</em>.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On the following page, participants rated their own morality relative to other students on campus on a scale ranging from 0% ( <em>you are the least moral student on campus</em>) to 100% ( <em>you are the most moral student on campus</em>) and a midpoint of 50% ( <em>average</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Then, under the heading “mood and emotion survey,” they answered the question “How do you feel <u>right now</u>?” by rating each of the following 24 states on a scale ranging from 1 ( <em>does not apply at all</em>) to 7 ( <em>applies very much</em>): disappointed with myself, good, uncomfortable, happy with myself, determined, annoyed with myself, happy, guilty, comfortable with myself, peaceful, uneasy, disgusted with myself, excited, pleased with myself, energetic, angry with myself, bothered, friendly, dissatisfied with myself, fatigued, self-critical, optimistic, secure with myself, and lonely.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Finally, participants rated his or her agreement with the following items introduced in Study 3 on a 7-point scale ranging from −3 ( <em>strongly disagree</em>) to +3 ( <em>strongly agree</em>): “I am very happy with my choice of a suspect”; “My choice is representative of my attitudes and values”; “Anyone would have picked the same suspect as I did”; “The information presented was sufficient to lead me to the correct choice”; and “I had no other choice but to select the most obvious subject.” </span><span class="sentence">On the same page, they indicated how the other participant would like and respect them after seeing their own answers on the police decision making task, using the first three scales used to rate the other participant.</span></p>
