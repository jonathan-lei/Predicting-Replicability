<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Experiment 1</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Experiment 1 used the following procedure to investigate whether stereotypes create illusory recollections of past events that are consistent with the stereotype. </span><span class="sentence">As in the Bayen et al. (2000) and Hicks and Cockman (2003) studies, our participants studied equal numbers of doctor-related, lawyer-related, and neutral sentences that were presented by two different male sources, Tom and Bill. </span><span class="sentence">At the time of the source memory test, participants were told that one source was a doctor and the other source was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, however, we manipulated the format of the source memory test across participants. </span><span class="sentence">Half of the participants initially made an “old–new” judgment and, for items judged old, participants then identified whether Tom or Bill was the source of the item. </span><span class="sentence">This procedure is comparable to the typical source test format. </span><span class="sentence">For the remaining participants, however, the format of the source memory test differed after they made their initial old–new judgment. </span><span class="sentence">For items judged old, these participants then made a source judgment about who presented it during the study phase or they responded that they could not remember the source (i.e., Tom, Bill, or don't know). </span><span class="sentence">Critically, these participants were directed to select Tom or Bill only if they vividly remembered the source that presented the item during the study phase. </span><span class="sentence">We used instructions similar to those used to guide participants to make a “remember” response in the remember–know paradigm (e.g., Gardiner &amp; Java, 1993; Tulving, 1985). </span><span class="sentence">If participants did not experience a vivid recollection, they were told to respond “don't know.” </span><span class="sentence">Above all, participants were instructed not to guess the source. </span><span class="sentence">A similar don't know procedure has been used by others to increase the likelihood that a source attribution is based on a convincing sense of remembering and not on a guess (e.g., Gallo &amp; Roediger, 2003; Lampinen, Neuschatz, &amp; Payne, 1999; Macrae, Schloerscheidt, Bodenhausen, &amp; Milne, 2002; D. G. Payne et al., 1996; Roediger, McDermott, Pisoni, &amp; Gallo, 2004).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We expected the standard source test to replicate existing studies and show stereotype-biased performance. </span><span class="sentence">This test, however, is unable to discriminate between the guessing and illusory recollection accounts because both processes can yield the same pattern of results. </span><span class="sentence">Participants can select an incorrect, but stereotype-consistent, source because they fail to recollect source information and guess in a stereotype-consistent manner. </span><span class="sentence">Alternatively, participants may select the incorrect source because they experience an illusory and false recollection. </span><span class="sentence">The standard test confounds both of these processes.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The modified source test was designed to separate the contributions of guessing and illusory recollections to performance. </span><span class="sentence">The guessing hypothesis predicts that there should be no subjective experience of recollection that is associated with incorrect responses. </span><span class="sentence">Participants should respond don't know rather than guess Tom or Bill under the modified test instructions. </span><span class="sentence">Responding with don't know instead of guessing a source greatly reduces or eliminates the pattern of biased source attributions, whereby correctly remembering the source is superior for the stereotype-consistent over the stereotype-inconsistent items. </span><span class="sentence">By contrast, the retrieval expectation hypothesis assumes that errors in this paradigm can be recollection based. </span><span class="sentence">When participants fail to select the correct source, they will likely choose the incorrect source rather than respond don't know. </span><span class="sentence">In sum, the guessing hypothesis predicts an interaction between the test condition (i.e., the standard test format vs. the modified test format) and the degree of match between the profession of the source and the content of the test statement. </span><span class="sentence">The retrieval expectation hypothesis, by contrast, predicts no such interaction.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Sixty-four undergraduate students from the University of Virginia participated in this experiment in exchange for course credit. </span><span class="sentence">The participants were randomly assigned to either the modified source test condition (i.e., the source test contains a don't know response option) or the standard source test condition (i.e., the source test does not contain a don't know response option).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design and Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The stimulus material, adopted from Bayen et al. (2000), consisted of 192 sentences that were presented visually only. </span><span class="sentence">The sentences were divided into three categories on the basis of their content: 64 doctor-related items, 64 lawyer-related items, and 64 profession-neutral items. </span><span class="sentence">Within each category, there were 32 target sentences (e.g. “Do you have any food allergies?”) and 32 distractor sentences that were identical to the targets, except for the modification of one or two words (e.g. “Do you have any drug allergies?”).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">During the study session, 96 items (i.e., 32 target sentences from each category) were presented simultaneously with a color photo of one of two middle-aged Caucasian male faces, labeled Bill or Tom. </span><span class="sentence">Each source was paired with 16 sentences from each of the three categories. </span><span class="sentence">An additional 6 filler items at the beginning and the end of the study phase were included so as to reduce primacy and recency effects.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The test phase consisted of 48 studied items intermixed with 48 distractor items (i.e., new items). </span><span class="sentence">Sixteen studied items were from each category, with an equal number associated with the sources Bill and Tom. </span><span class="sentence">Moreover, the new distractor items included 16 doctor sentences, 16 lawyer sentences, and 16 neutral sentences. </span><span class="sentence">There were an additional 6 practice items at the beginning of the test, which were used to demonstrate the task to participants.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">All study and test items were presented in a random order, with the constraint that no more than 3 items of a particular type could appear consecutively. </span><span class="sentence">The experimental program was created with E-prime Version 1.1 (2002), and the sentences and photos were presented on a 17-in. </span><span class="sentence">(43.2-cm) monitor. </span><span class="sentence">Finally, across participants, we counterbalanced (a) assignment of sentences to the target and distractor conditions and (b) assignment of sentences to both sources.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The study items were presented in an incidental manner. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told that they would see a series of sentences, and each would be associated with a person, Bill or Tom, represented by the individual's picture. </span><span class="sentence">They were asked to rate how easily they could imagine the source, either Bill or Tom, saying the sentence. </span><span class="sentence">Responses were made on a keyboard with a 5-point Likert scale to identify the difficulty of imagining the sentences. </span><span class="sentence">No mention was made of the subsequent memory test. </span><span class="sentence">Presentation proceeded at the rate of one sentence every 3.5 s, and participants were asked to make their imageability response before this time elapsed.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After viewing the study items, participants were told about the surprise source memory test. </span><span class="sentence">However, before the test began, they were informed that it would be helpful for them to know that one speaker was, in fact, a lawyer, and the other was a doctor. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told that the test would consist of studied sentences as well as new sentences that had not been encountered earlier. </span><span class="sentence">All test items appeared visually at the top of the screen, with either the old–new question (i.e., “Was this sentence presented by one of the sources earlier?”) or the source question (i.e., “Who originally presented this statement. </span><span class="sentence">Was it Bill or Tom?”) appearing 3 cm below the test item. </span><span class="sentence">Pictures of the two sources were shown underneath the source question in the center of the screen with their name and assigned profession (e.g., “Bill, lawyer”) below the corresponding picture.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the standard source test condition, participants first determined whether the sentence was old (a previously presented item) or new. </span><span class="sentence">For test items receiving a response of old, participants then identified whether the sentence had been paired earlier with Bill or with Tom during the study phase. </span><span class="sentence">In the modified source test condition, participants also first determined whether the sentence was old or new. </span><span class="sentence">For items receiving a response of old, participants decided whether the item was presented earlier by Bill or by Tom or whether they could not remember (i.e., don't know). </span><span class="sentence">During the test instructions, participants were told that it was important for them to respond Bill or Tom only if they vividly recollected the source presenting the item during the study phase. </span><span class="sentence">Moreover, participants were warned not to guess and to select don't know if they could not distinctly remember who presented the item during the study phase. </span><span class="sentence">For every test item, the following reminder not to guess appeared at the bottom of the screen, “It's important that you don't guess. </span><span class="sentence">Only respond `Tom' or `Bill' if you specifically remember one of them presenting the statement, otherwise respond `don't know'.” </span><span class="sentence">In sum, the modified source test and standard source test conditions were identical in every respect except for the don't know option and its associated instructions. </span><span class="sentence">In both conditions, participants progressed through the test at their own pace.</span></p>
