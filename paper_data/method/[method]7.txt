<h3>Study 1: Affective Coherence Between Concepts and Motor Behavior</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The first study investigated affective recall as a function of primed mental content and motivationally relevant approach–avoidance behaviors. </span><span class="sentence">We predicted that the coherence between such actions and the content of currently accessible thoughts should facilitate information processing.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The relevance of such actions to recall was previously demonstrated by Förster and Strack (1997, 1998), who asked participants to generate the names of liked, disliked, or neutral persons while engaging in either arm flexion (approach action) or arm extension (avoidance action). </span><span class="sentence">Förster and Strack (1997) reasoned that the positive–negative associations to approach–avoidance behaviors and affective evaluation would lead to biased memory search. </span><span class="sentence">Indeed, arm flexion was associated with the generation of more positive names, and arm contraction was associated with the generation of more negative names. </span><span class="sentence">The second set of investigations (Förster &amp; Strack, 1998) identified an important boundary condition for arm contraction effects— the presence of an affective, evaluative context. </span><span class="sentence">As previously noted by Cacioppo et al. (1993), Förster and Strack (1998) found that the effect of arm contraction on memory retrieval occurred only during an evaluative task such as generating the names of liked, disliked, or neutral persons. </span><span class="sentence">When names were generated first and subsequently evaluated during arm contraction, no effect was found.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Recent results from studies by Centerbar and Clore (2006) further clarified such approach–avoidance motor effects. </span><span class="sentence">They extended the original work of Cacioppo and colleagues (1993) by showing that the effect of approach–avoidance motor action on evaluation of ideographs depended on subtle pre-existing differences in the affective valence of the ideographs. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast to the original work by Cacioppo and colleagues (1993), both an approach action with positive ideographs and a withdrawal action with negative ideographs produced more positive attitudes toward the ideographs. </span><span class="sentence">Avoidance did not lead to more negative attitudes, as previous data would have suggested. </span><span class="sentence">Centerbar and Clore (2006) explained this result in terms of a motivational compatibility model. </span><span class="sentence">Approach is a motivationally compatible action for positive stimuli, and avoidance is a motivationally compatible action for negative stimuli. </span><span class="sentence">Motivationally compatible actions produced more favorable attitudes than incompatible ones, with no evidence of a main effect of arm contraction. </span><span class="sentence">Further, no effect of arm contraction was found with neutral ideographs, a finding that further supports the compatibility interpretation.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Centerbar and Clore (2006) found additionally that motivationally compatible actions affected not only evaluations of the focal stimuli (ideographs) but also, under some conditions, evaluations of the pleasantness of the arm contractions themselves. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, the stimulus–action combination may produce an experience of fluency, or positive affect, which can then affect evaluation of one's own momentary experience. </span><span class="sentence">This suggests that such motivationally compatible actions might produce an experience of ease that could facilitate ongoing processing more generally.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the present studies, we therefore hypothesized that the effects of approach–avoidance actions should again depend on the interaction of the action and the valence of primed affective concepts. </span><span class="sentence">We predicted that this interaction should influence the ease of processing and later recall of events from a story. </span><span class="sentence">We subtly primed participants with happy, sad, or neutral words, using a scrambled sentences task. </span><span class="sentence">To the extent that primed concepts elicit tendencies to approach or avoid, as shown by Solarz (1960) and Chen and Bargh (1999), we predicted that people's particular actions would be motivationally compatible or incompatible experiences. </span><span class="sentence">The combinations of approach with positive primes or avoidance with negative primes should be affectively coherent, thereby facilitating processing of affective material during the memory task. </span><span class="sentence">Alternatively, combinations of approach actions with negative primes or avoidance actions with positive primes should be affectively incoherent, disrupting efficient processing and recall. </span><span class="sentence">Since neutral primes should have no implications for approach–avoidance action, we expected no effects in the neutral prime condition.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were 59 undergraduate students (33 men, 26 women) from the University of Virginia psychology participant pool who took part in exchange for course credit. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were tested individually and in small groups (up to 4 at a time). </span><span class="sentence">The data of 3 participants were excluded from analyses because they did not follow instructions, leaving data for 56 participants (32, men, 24 women).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were informed that they would engage in various tasks, including isometric exercises involving their nondominant arm. </span><span class="sentence">The cover story (adapted from Friedman &amp; Förster, 2000) suggested that the arm positions were related to differential brain hemispheric activation. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter demonstrated the correct arm position for both arm flexion and arm extension and explained that for arm flexion, the participant should bend the arm at the elbow to make a 90° angle, place the palm of the hand under the tabletop, and press lightly against the bottom edge of the table. </span><span class="sentence">For arm extension, the participant was told to extend the arm straight, place the palm on the tabletop, and apply a small amount of pressure against the tabletop. </span><span class="sentence">A booklet contained instructions for the following tasks.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Priming procedure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The scrambled sentences task (adapted from Costin, 1969) involved 40 strings of four words. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were to underline any three words in each string that could be combined to form a sentence. </span><span class="sentence">A practice item illustrated that for each item, there were two ways to combine three of the four words to complete a sentence. </span><span class="sentence">For example, the word string “the book close read” could be combined to form either “close the book” or “read the book.” </span><span class="sentence">Participants were asked to work quickly. </span><span class="sentence">The arm movements were not performed during the priming task.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of three priming conditions (happy, sad, or neutral). </span><span class="sentence">In the happy and sad conditions, half of the 40 items were valenced, and half were neutral. </span><span class="sentence">Valenced items included such strings as “kids played smiled happily” and “depressed seemed they you.” </span><span class="sentence">An example of a neutral string is “the book close read.”</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Recall task</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Subsequently, participants read a story (adapted from Bower, Gilligan, &amp; Monteiro, 1981) about a fictional character, “Paul.” </span><span class="sentence">In the story, Paul relates 10 happy and 10 sad events from his past. </span><span class="sentence">On the basis of random assignment, participants engaged in one of the two previously demonstrated arm positions as they read the story.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Afterward, participants completed two filler tasks—drawing a picture of the continental United States and counting backwards from 200 by 3's. </span><span class="sentence">Next, they answered questions about Paul, the character in the story. </span><span class="sentence">They judged Paul's happiness and sadness on scales from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 10 (<em>extremely</em>) and answered two liking questions: “How favorable do you feel toward Paul?” (−5 = <em>extremely unfavorable</em>, 5 = <em>extremely favorable</em>), and “How much do you think that you would like Paul if you were to get to know him” (−5 = <em>not at all</em>, 5 = <em>very much</em>). </span><span class="sentence">After completing these judgments, participants had 5 min to write down as many of the events as they could recall from the story about Paul.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Reported feelings</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After completing the recall task, participants rated their current feelings using 15 affect-related words. </span><span class="sentence">They indicated, on a scale from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 9 (<em>extremely</em>), how much they were currently experiencing the following feelings: “calm,” “sad,” “relieved,” “happy,” “anxious,” “cheerful,” “relaxed,” “aroused,” “pleased,” “distressed,” “nervous,” “miserable,” “delighted,” “stimulated,” and “gloomy.” </span><span class="sentence">They then rated their overall mood (“How positive or negative overall do you feel right now?”) on a scale from 1 (<em>extremely negative</em>) to 9 (<em>extremely positive</em>). </span><span class="sentence">They also rated the arm movement task in terms of pleasantness (1 = <em>very unpleasant</em>, 9 = <em>very pleasant</em>) and effort (1 = <em>not at all effortful</em>, 9 = <em>very effortful</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Participants further indicated how enjoyable the scrambled sentences task was (1 = <em>not at all enjoyable</em>, 9 = <em>extremely enjoyable</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Finally, participants completed personality measures and answered open-ended questions probing for suspicions about the hypotheses.</span></p>
