<h3>Study 5: Affective Coherence and the Construction of Narrative Meaning</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In four experiments, we exposed participants to <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">concepts</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> experiential cues: approach and avoidance behaviors (Studies 1 and 2), moods (Study 3), and expressive behaviors (Study 4). We then assessed subsequent recall of <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> information. In each experiment, we observed that recall was superior <strong data-auto="strong_text">when</strong> there was coherence between affectively relevant sources compared with <strong data-auto="strong_text">when</strong> there was <strong data-auto="strong_text">incoherence</strong> between sources. The evidence, <strong data-auto="strong_text">when</strong> taken together, suggested to us that participants experienced differences in fluency in these <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> contexts. Although we did not investigate mediating processes directly, we surmised that fluency differences would have influenced the ease or difficulty of subsequent processing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As noted earlier, <em>fluency</em> describes the ease of processing continuous information (Winkielman et al., 2003). In the four studies that we have reported thus far, such a metacognitive feeling of fluency might be created <strong data-auto="strong_text">when</strong> several sources of <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> information are coherent, <strong data-auto="strong_text">when</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">concepts</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> experiences are in sync. The results of Studies 1 and 2, both of which included a neutral priming condition, indicated that coherence was facilitative, whereas <strong data-auto="strong_text">incoherence</strong> was inhibitory, in their effects on processing. To the extent that the fluency associated with <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> coherence is the driving force, we would expect that additional aspects of information processing might also be facilitated. For example, coherence would not only enhance recall but also the ease with which recalled information is generated.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternatively, the presumed disfluency associated with the experience of <strong data-auto="strong_text">incoherence</strong> would likely be experienced as problematic and thus disruptive to ongoing processing. To the extent that the <strong data-auto="strong_text">incoherence</strong> suggests an ambiguous <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> situation, people may experience more uncertainty in how to respond to or make sense of the situation. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> meaning of the situation may be unclear.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To explore the nature of qualitative differences associated with <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> coherence and <strong data-auto="strong_text">incoherence</strong>, we chose to examine differences in measures of linguistic style by having people construct self-narratives. Extensive research has demonstrated that as people actively work to understand unpleasant life experiences, their narrative descriptions of those experiences change. Making sense of such experiences influences markers of emotional well-being. For example, Pennebaker (1997) observed that the individuals who experienced health benefits from writing about traumatic events were those who “began with poorly organized descriptions and progressed to coherent stories by the last day of writing” (p. 165). People experiencing the ease and fluency associated with <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> coherence should be more likely to demonstrate corresponding coherence in their self-generated narratives. In contrast, disfluency associated with <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">incoherence</strong> should be more likely to manifest itself in less coherent self-narratives.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To explore these possibilities, we again exposed participants to <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">concepts</strong> as they engaged in expressive behaviors. But this time, we measured indicators of the ease with which information was generated and the quality of the output. An autobiographical recall task was used to provide the participant with flexibility about the kind of information to be generated. Participants were exposed to neutral cue words (e.g., “tree”) and were asked to think of an experience from their own life associated with this word and to write a brief narrative about the nature of that experience.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One of our interests was the extent to which participants generated either more or less information depending on whether they were experiencing <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> coherence or <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">incoherence</strong>. We considered two distinct possibilities. If <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> coherence results in fluency that facilitates processing generally, then participants in the coherent conditions might be more generative in their narratives. That is, <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> coherence should facilitate the fluency of their written expression generally, leading to longer narratives. Alternatively, if <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">incoherence</strong> motivates an attempt to extract meaning from incoherent <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> cues, then participants in the incoherent conditions might generate more material.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another of our interests was the qualitative content of the generated narratives. Because certain types of words are associated with cognitive complexity (Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2003), we examined the content of the narratives. In particular, we tested whether differences in <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> coherence would affect linguistic markers of complexity (e.g., Pennebaker, Mayne, &amp; Francis, 1997; Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2003). These markers include the use of long words (&gt; six letters) and words related to causation and insight. Pennebaker and colleagues also found that the content of narratives tends to change over time (Pennebaker &amp; Francis, 1999; Pennebaker et al., 1997; Pennebaker &amp; Stone, 2003). They showed that improvements in adjustment across writing sessions correlated with increased use of causal and insight words, suggesting that people had come to a more meaningful understanding of the unpleasant life events. To determine whether temporal factors might also influence the degree to which <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> coherence influenced self-generated narrative content, we analyzed changes in story content across narratives.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thus, the question posed in Study 5 was whether <strong data-auto="strong_text">affective</strong> coherence would influence general processing efficiency, such as the length and complexity of the narratives that the participants produced, or whether such differences would be specifically related to meaning making—the emergent meaning of the narrative generated.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 144 undergraduate students (59 men, 85 women; mean age, 19.17 years) from the University of Virginia who took part to fulfill a course requirement. The data of 11 participants were eliminated from analyses because they demonstrated suspicion about the purpose of the study, leaving the data from 133 participants (57 men, 76 women).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The procedure was similar to that used in Study 4, with the following exceptions. Participants were given the same scrambled sentences task as in Studies 1–3 and were then instructed to engage in muscle contractions associated with happy or sad expressions as in Study 4. However, instead of reading the Paul story, participants engaged in an autobiographical recall task developed by Teasdale and Fogarty (1979) and used by Schnall and Laird (2003). For this task, participants received a cue word (e.g., “tree”) while producing the emotional expressions. Participants were asked to close their eyes while maintaining the muscle contractions and to think of an event from their life associated with the word. They were instructed to think of the first event that came to mind, to consider what the experience was like, and to recall the event in as much detail as possible. Afterward, they wrote down the nature of the event and the effect it had on them. To maximize variability in responses, the experimenters did not time this task and simply encouraged participants to “write down a couple of sentences” about the event. The participants then rated the event on a scale from 1 (<em>very bad</em>) to 7 (<em>very good</em>) and indicated the extent to which they had experienced various feelings <strong data-auto="strong_text">when</strong> the event originally happened (“happy,” “sad,” “confused,” “angry,” “relaxed,” “afraid,” “depressed,” “upset”). The same retrieval and ratings procedure was repeated for each of three cue words: “tree,” “house,” and “car.” Then participants indicated their feelings during the experiment using visual analogue scales for the same adjectives (in a different order). Finally, participants filled out <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> questionnaires not pertinent to the current project.</p>
