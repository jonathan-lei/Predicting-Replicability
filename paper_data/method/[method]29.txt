All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were recruited from the Washington University (Experiments 1 and 2); the University at Albany, State University of New York (Experiment 3); and the University of Waterloo (Experiment 4) participant pools.<br /><br /> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/40469a014cd09d2668372e6e2d3d9f63/5ebcb194/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-3-495-tbl1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-3-495-tbl1a.gif" title="Mean Age, Years of Education, and Vocabulary Age (in Years) of Participants (Standard Deviations in Parentheses)" /><em>Mean Age, Years of Education, and Vocabulary Age (in Years) of Participants (Standard Deviations in Parentheses)</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">An IBM-compatible computer running E-prime software (Schneider, Eschman, &amp; Zuccolotto, 2001) was used to control <strong data-auto="strong_text">stimulus</strong> presentation and to collect data. The stimuli were displayed on a 17-in. Super VGA monitor, and participants' responses were made on a computer keyboard. <sup></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stimuli for the LDT consisted of 200 words, 200 length-matched pronounceable nonwords (Experiment 1), and 200 length-matched pseudohomophones (Experiments 2, 3, and 4; see
Appendix for a full list of stimuli). One hundred words were desig nated high <strong data-auto="strong_text">frequency</strong> (mean counts per million = 1,227) and 100 words low <strong data-auto="strong_text">frequency</strong> (mean counts per million = 44; Lund &amp; Burgess, 1996). For high-<strong data-auto="strong_text">frequency</strong> words, the mean length was 4.73 letters (<em>SD</em> = .96), and the mean orthographic neighborhood size (N) (Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, &amp; Besner, 1977) was 4.77. For low-<strong data-auto="strong_text">frequency</strong> words, the mean length was 4.78 letters (<em>SD</em> = .85), and the mean N was 4.82. There was no significant difference between high- and low-<strong data-auto="strong_text">frequency</strong> words with respect to length (<em>t</em> &lt; 1) and orthographic neighborhood size (<em>t</em> &lt; 1). For the legal nonwords and pseudohomophones, the mean Ns were 3.38 and 4.66, respectively, <em>p</em> = .002. <sup></sup> For the pseudohomophones, the mean baseword <strong data-auto="strong_text">frequency</strong> (i.e., the <strong data-auto="strong_text">frequency</strong> of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">word</strong> BRAIN for the nonword BRANE) was 647 counts per million.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were tested individually in sound-attenuated cubicles under standard lighting conditions, sitting about 60 cm from the computer screen. After completing a computer-administered 40-item Shipley (1940) vocabulary task, participants were told that letter strings would be presented at the center of the screen and that they were to indicate as quickly and accurately as possible via a button press on the keyboard whether the letter string spelled a <strong data-auto="strong_text">word</strong> they knew or not. Twenty practice trials were then presented, followed by five <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> blocks of 80 trials, with mandatory breaks between blocks. The order in which stimuli were presented was randomized anew for each participant, with clear and degraded trials randomly intermixed within each block. All stimuli were uppercase and were presented in the 14-point Courier font. For the degradation condition, letter strings were rapidly alternated with a randomly generated mask of the same length. For example, the mask &amp;?# was presented for 14 ms, followed by DOG for 28 ms; and the two were repeatedly alternated until the participant responded. The mask was generated from random permutations of the symbols @, #, $, %, &amp;, ?, and *, with the proviso that the mask be the same length as the string and that symbols not be repeated within a mask. Each trial consisted of the following order of events: (a) a fixation point (+) at the center of the monitor for 400 ms, (b) a blank screen for 200 ms, and (c) a <strong data-auto="strong_text">stimulus</strong> centered at the fixation point's location. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">stimulus</strong> remained on the screen until a keyboard response was made. Participants pressed the apostrophe key for words and the <em>A</em> key for nonwords. Each correct response was followed by a 1,600 ms delay. If a response was incorrect, a 170 ms tone was presented simultaneously with the onset of a 450 ms presentation of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">word</strong> “Incorrect” (displayed slightly below the fixation point). In order to keep the delay between the response to a <strong data-auto="strong_text">stimulus</strong> and the presentation of the next <strong data-auto="strong_text">stimulus</strong> constant across correct and incorrect trials, each incorrect response was followed by a 1,150-ms delay.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A 2 × 2 factorial design was used: both <strong data-auto="strong_text">stimulus</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">quality</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">word</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frequency</strong> were manipulated within participants. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">stimulus</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">quality</strong> of each item was also counterbalanced across participants, so that there were 50 observations for each of the four <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> conditions.</p>
