<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">THE EXPERIMENT: GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR IN THE IPD AND IPD-MD GAMES</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">We conducted a laboratory experiment that compared behavior in the IPD and IPD-MD games. </span><span class="sentence">In half the experimental sessions, the participants made their decisions without communicating with the other in-group members. </span><span class="sentence">In the other half, group members met for a short discussion before making their decisions. </span><span class="sentence">Allowing group members to communicate (even when, as in the present experiment, communication is nonbinding and has no payoff consequences) has been shown to increase cooperation in one-shot social dilemmas (see Weber, Kopelman, &amp; Messick, 2004, for a review), including the IPD game (Bornstein, 1992). </span><span class="sentence">Communication increases cooperation by enhancing group identity and commitment (e.g., Kerr &amp; Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994), eliciting relevant social norms (Bicchieri, 2002), and manipulating perceptions of the in-group and the out-group (Bornstein, 1992). </span><span class="sentence">Studying the IPD and IPD-MD games played without and with communication enabled us to determine the extent to which individual decisions are motivated by in-group love or out-group hate, and whether the intragroup processes that take place during discussion affect the relative significance of these two motives.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Method</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>Participants</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Two hundred forty male students participated (mean age = 24 years, SD = 3). </span><span class="sentence"><sup>2</sup> They were recruited using ads promising a monetary reward for participation in a group decision-making experiment.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Design and Procedure</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants arrived at the laboratory in cohorts of 6 and were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions (IPD or IPD-MD with or without intragroup communication). </span><span class="sentence">The participants in each cohort were randomly divided into two 3-person groups. </span><span class="sentence">Each participant was escorted into a private room, where he was given instructions concerning the rules and payoffs of the relevant game. </span><span class="sentence">The instructions were phrased in neutral language (e.g., the pools were labeled “A” and “B,” with no reference to “cooperation” or “competition”) and explained how each player's own decision and the decisions of the other players would affect the payoffs. </span><span class="sentence">Participants subsequently answered a short quiz that tested their understanding of the game's rules.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Each participant received an endowment of 10 tokens and had to indicate on a “decision form” how many tokens he was keeping, how many he was contributing to pool W (the within-group pool in the IPD-MD game), and how many he was contributing to pool B (the between-group pool in the IPD-MD game and the only pool in the IPD game). </span><span class="sentence">Each token that was contributed to either pool W or pool B paid 1 NIS (new Israeli shekel) to each in-group member, including the contributor. </span><span class="sentence">Each token that was contributed to pool B also subtracted 1 NIS from the payoff to each out-group member. </span><span class="sentence">For each token a player kept, he was paid 2 NIS. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, each player was paid a flat bonus of 30 NIS to ensure that payoffs would be positive. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, participants could earn between 10 NIS and 70 NIS (approximately $2.50 to $17.50), depending on the outcome of the game.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Participants in the no-communication condition made their decisions without communicating with the other in-group members. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in the communication condition met with the other members of their team for 5 min of free discussion and then returned to their rooms to make their decisions in private. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were explicitly assured that their decisions would remain confidential.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">After submitting their decisions, but before learning the outcomes of the game, participants responded to a postexperimental questionnaire assessing their expectations regarding the behavior of in-group and out-group members (i.e., how many chips, on average, in-group and out-group members had contributed to each of the pools).</span></p>
