<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This experiment takes as a starting point Lavis and Mitchell's (2006) demonstration of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">intermixed</strong>–<strong data-auto="strong_text">blocked</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> using visual stimuli in humans. Examples of the stimuli, complex and very similar checkerboards, are presented in Figure 1. Using stimuli of this sort, Lavis and Mitchell showed that discrimination, as assessed by a same–different test procedure, was enhanced after preexposure, in which the stimuli were presented on an <strong data-auto="strong_text">intermixed</strong> schedule (AX/BX). Comparison was made with the performance shown to other stimuli (CX and DX) that were preexposed in separate blocks of trials. In that experiment, the <strong data-auto="strong_text">spacing</strong> of trials was uniform, which meant that the interval between successive presentations of AX (or of BX) was twice that separating successive presentations of CX (or of DX). In this experiment we repeated the AX/BX preexposure condition and also presented CX in a separate block of trials. In this <strong data-auto="strong_text">blocked</strong> condition, stimulus presentations were massed. However, presentations of a second <strong data-auto="strong_text">blocked</strong> stimulus, DX, were separated by an interval corresponding to one stimulus presentation. Thus, the <strong data-auto="strong_text">spacing</strong> of DX presentations was equivalent to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">spacing</strong> of AX (and BX) presentations. On the test trials that followed preexposure, the participants were required to discriminate each of the compound cues (AX, BX, CX, and DX) from X. We predicted that if superior performance following <strong data-auto="strong_text">intermixed</strong> preexposure (AX/BX) is due to temporal <strong data-auto="strong_text">spacing</strong> alone, then the DX stimulus in the spaced condition would be easily discriminated from the common X cue on test.<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/516dafee83937726e94c2bc4113728dc/5ebcaef8/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-1-237-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-237-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

The common X element was created by coloring 156 of the 400 squares green, red, yellow, purple, or blue. The remaining background squares were colored gray. The unique features A, B, C, and D were added by changing groups of six adjacent gray squares to one of the brighter colors. The added unique features differed both in color and in location on the checkerboard. The location of a given unique feature was constant across exposures. The area of the screen around the checkerboard was the same gray color as the gray squares of the checkerboard. A thick black border separated the checkerboard from the background. The individual squares within the checkerboard had no borders. The stimuli were presented on a 17 in. (43.18 cm) computer monitor and were approximately 8-cm square. Inquisit, Version 1.32 (Millisecond Software, Seattle, WA) was used to control stimulus presentation on an IBM-compatible PC.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There were three phases of preexposure. In the <strong data-auto="strong_text">intermixed</strong> phase, presentations of AX alternated with presentations of BX. In the <strong data-auto="strong_text">blocked</strong> phase, all presentations of CX were given consecutively, and in the spaced phase all presentations of DX were given sequentially, but a temporal delay was inserted between each <strong data-auto="strong_text">trial</strong>. The order of these three phases was counterbalanced across participants. Allocation of the stimuli shown in Figure 1 to conditions was counterbalanced such that each stimulus was presented equally as often in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">intermixed</strong>, <strong data-auto="strong_text">blocked</strong>, and spaced conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">At the start of the experiment, participants were seated approximately 60 cm from the computer monitor and were presented with the instructions on the screen. They were told to pay attention to the stimuli, that any stimulus differences they detected would be useful later in the experiment, and to press the space bar to proceed from one <strong data-auto="strong_text">trial</strong> to the next. During the preexposure phase, each stimulus was displayed 60 times, for a duration of 470 ms on each occasion. Each individual stimulus presentation, in both the <strong data-auto="strong_text">blocked</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">intermixed</strong> phases, was followed by a blank gray screen during which participants made their space bar presses. In fact, the following <strong data-auto="strong_text">trial</strong> was initiated after 2,000 ms whether a press was made or not. In the spaced condition, the interstimulus interval was increased to 4,470 ms. This is the equivalent of the delay created between each AX presentation by the presentation of BX on alternate trials (and vice versa) in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">intermixed</strong> condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">At the completion of the preexposure phase, participants were informed that in a second phase, they would be presented with pairs of checkerboards, one pair at a time. They were told to press the <em>A</em> key if these two stimuli appeared to be the same, and the <em>5</em> key on the number pad if the stimuli appeared to be different. A reminder about which keys to press remained on the screen throughout the test period. Participants were also told not to spend too long on each judgment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There were six types of test <strong data-auto="strong_text">trial</strong>: (1) <strong data-auto="strong_text">intermixed</strong> different, in which AX and X (or BX and X) were presented; (2) <strong data-auto="strong_text">intermixed</strong> same, in which AX and AX (or BX and BX) were presented; (3) <strong data-auto="strong_text">blocked</strong> different, in which CX and X were presented; (4) <strong data-auto="strong_text">blocked</strong> same, in which CX and CX were presented; (5) spaced different, in which DX and X were presented; and (6) spaced same, in which DX and DX were presented. The order of stimulus presentation was randomized across test trials. Each unique feature (A–D) was presented on 12 trials in total, there being 6 different trials and 6 same trials with each.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Test trials consisted of the presentation of one stimulus for 800 ms, followed by a blank screen for 550 ms and the presentation of the second stimulus for 800 ms. A white square was then presented in place of the checkerboard, and it remained on the screen until the response was made.</p> <h4>Scoring</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A set of planned contrasts using a multivariate, repeated measures model (O'Brien &amp; Kaiser, 1985) was used to analyze the data from this and all subsequent experiments. A significance level of <em>p</em> &lt; .05 was set for all of the statistical analyses.</p>
