<h3>Study 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In Study 1, we demonstrated that a meaningful ending gave rise to the experience of poignancy. </span><span class="sentence">In that study, we used a guided imagery induction in a laboratory setting to evoke poignancy. </span><span class="sentence">Although past research has demonstrated that guided imagery inductions can be used as an effective tool to generate an emotional experience (Gerrardshesse, Spies, &amp; Hesse, 1994), a question remains: Do endings in a natural setting also elicit poignancy? </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, can the salience of an ending be emphasized to amplify the feeling of poignancy? </span><span class="sentence">To answer these questions, in Study 2, we surveyed graduating college students about their emotional experiences on graduation day. </span><span class="sentence">For some participants, we emphasized the ending that they were experiencing (limited-time condition), whereas for other participants, we did not emphasize the ending that they were experiencing (control condition). </span><span class="sentence">It is important to note that because all participants were experiencing an ending, we expected feelings of poignancy to be relatively high in both conditions. </span><span class="sentence">However, because we placed emphasis on the ending in the limited-time condition, we expected poignancy to be even higher in that condition than in the control condition.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">One hundred ten graduating seniors at Stanford University (49 men, <em>M</em> = 22.06 years; 56 women, <em>M</em> = 21.80 years, and 5 participants who failed to report their age or gender) participated in the study. </span><span class="sentence">Seniors were approached on graduation day, June 18, 2006, and asked whether they would like to participate in a brief survey about their experiences.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Experimental Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Study 2 was composed of two between-subjects conditions. </span><span class="sentence">In each condition, participants were asked to rate the degree that they were experiencing each of 19 different emotions on a 7-point scale (positive: accomplishment, amusement, contentment, excitement, happiness, interest, joy, and pride; negative: anger, anxiety, boredom, disgust, embarrassment, fear, frustration, guilt, irritation, sadness, and shame). </span><span class="sentence">In the control condition (<em>n</em> = 59), participants were given the following instructions: “Keeping in mind your current experiences, please rate the degree to which you feel each of the following emotions,” and were then presented with the list of 19 emotions. </span><span class="sentence">In the limited-time condition (<em>n</em> = 51), in which emphasis was placed on the ending that they were experiencing, participants were given the following instructions: “As a graduating senior, today is the last day that you will be a student at Stanford. </span><span class="sentence">Keeping that in mind, please rate the degree to which you feel each of the following emotions,” and were then presented with the list of 19 emotions.</span></p>
