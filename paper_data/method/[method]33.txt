<h3>Study 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In Study 1, we demonstrated that a <strong data-auto="strong_text">meaningful</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">ending</strong> gave rise to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experience</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">poignancy</strong>. In that study, we used a guided imagery induction in a laboratory setting to evoke <strong data-auto="strong_text">poignancy</strong>. Although past research has demonstrated that guided imagery inductions can be used as an effective tool to generate an <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotional</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">experience</strong> (Gerrardshesse, Spies, &amp; Hesse, 1994), a question remains: Do <strong data-auto="strong_text">endings</strong> in a natural setting also elicit <strong data-auto="strong_text">poignancy</strong>? Furthermore, can the salience of an <strong data-auto="strong_text">ending</strong> be emphasized to amplify the feeling of <strong data-auto="strong_text">poignancy</strong>? To answer these questions, in Study 2, we surveyed graduating college students about their <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotional</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">experiences</strong> on graduation day. For some participants, we emphasized the <strong data-auto="strong_text">ending</strong> that they were experiencing (limited-time condition), whereas for other participants, we did not emphasize the <strong data-auto="strong_text">ending</strong> that they were experiencing (control condition). It is important to note that because all participants were experiencing an <strong data-auto="strong_text">ending</strong>, we expected feelings of <strong data-auto="strong_text">poignancy</strong> to be relatively high in both conditions. However, because we placed emphasis on the <strong data-auto="strong_text">ending</strong> in the limited-time condition, we expected <strong data-auto="strong_text">poignancy</strong> to be even higher in that condition than in the control condition.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One hundred ten graduating seniors at Stanford University (49 men, <em>M</em> = 22.06 years; 56 women, <em>M</em> = 21.80 years, and 5 participants who failed to report their age or gender) participated in the study. Seniors were approached on graduation day, June 18, 2006, and asked whether they would like to participate in a brief survey about their <strong data-auto="strong_text">experiences</strong>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Experimental Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 2 was composed of two between-subjects conditions. In each condition, participants were asked to rate the degree that they were experiencing each of 19 different emotions on a 7-point scale (positive: accomplishment, amusement, contentment, excitement, happiness, interest, joy, and pride; negative: anger, anxiety, boredom, disgust, embarrassment, fear, frustration, guilt, irritation, sadness, and shame). In the control condition (<em>n</em> = 59), participants were given the following instructions: “Keeping in mind your current <strong data-auto="strong_text">experiences</strong>, please rate the degree to which you feel each of the following emotions,” and were then presented with the list of 19 emotions. In the limited-time condition (<em>n</em> = 51), in which emphasis was placed on the <strong data-auto="strong_text">ending</strong> that they were experiencing, participants were given the following instructions: “As a graduating senior, today is the last day that you will be a student at Stanford. Keeping that in mind, please rate the degree to which you feel each of the following emotions,” and were then presented with the list of 19 emotions.</p>
