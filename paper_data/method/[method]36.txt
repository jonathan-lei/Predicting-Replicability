<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 1 used the following procedure to investigate whether <strong data-auto="strong_text">stereotypes</strong> create <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong> of past events that are consistent with the stereotype. As in the Bayen et al. (2000) and Hicks and Cockman (2003) studies, our participants studied equal numbers of doctor-related, lawyer-related, and neutral sentences that were presented by two different male sources, Tom and Bill. At the time of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> test, participants were told that one <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> was a doctor and the other <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> was a lawyer. In addition, however, we manipulated the format of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> test across participants. Half of the participants initially made an “old–new” judgment and, for items judged old, participants then identified whether Tom or Bill was the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> of the item. This procedure is comparable to the typical <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test format. For the remaining participants, however, the format of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> test differed after they made their initial old–new judgment. For items judged old, these participants then made a <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> judgment about who presented it during the study phase or they responded that they could not remember the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> (i.e., Tom, Bill, or don't know). Critically, these participants were directed to select Tom or Bill only if they vividly remembered the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> that presented the item during the study phase. We used instructions similar to those used to guide participants to make a “remember” response in the remember–know paradigm (e.g., Gardiner &amp; Java, 1993; Tulving, 1985). If participants did not experience a vivid recollection, they were told to respond “don't know.” Above all, participants were instructed not to guess the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong>. A similar don't know procedure has been used by others to increase the likelihood that a <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> attribution is based on a convincing sense of remembering and not on a guess (e.g., Gallo &amp; Roediger, 2003; Lampinen, Neuschatz, &amp; Payne, 1999; Macrae, Schloerscheidt, Bodenhausen, &amp; Milne, 2002; D. G. Payne et al., 1996; Roediger, McDermott, Pisoni, &amp; Gallo, 2004).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We expected the standard <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test to replicate existing studies and show stereotype-biased performance. This test, however, is unable to discriminate between the guessing and <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> recollection accounts because both processes can yield the same pattern of results. Participants can select an incorrect, but stereotype-consistent, <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> because they fail to recollect <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> information and guess in a stereotype-consistent manner. Alternatively, participants may select the incorrect <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> because they experience an <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> and false recollection. The standard test confounds both of these processes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The modified <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test was designed to separate the contributions of guessing and <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong> to performance. The guessing hypothesis predicts that there should be no subjective experience of recollection that is associated with incorrect responses. Participants should respond don't know rather than guess Tom or Bill under the modified test instructions. Responding with don't know instead of guessing a <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> greatly reduces or eliminates the pattern of biased <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> attributions, whereby correctly remembering the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> is superior for the stereotype-consistent over the stereotype-inconsistent items. By contrast, the <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> expectation hypothesis assumes that errors in this paradigm can be recollection based. When participants fail to select the correct <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong>, they will likely choose the incorrect <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> rather than respond don't know. In sum, the guessing hypothesis predicts an interaction between the test condition (i.e., the standard test format vs. the modified test format) and the degree of match between the profession of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> and the content of the test statement. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> expectation hypothesis, by contrast, predicts no such interaction.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Sixty-four undergraduate students from the University of Virginia participated in this experiment in exchange for course credit. The participants were randomly assigned to either the modified <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test condition (i.e., the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test contains a don't know response option) or the standard <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test condition (i.e., the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test does not contain a don't know response option).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design and Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stimulus material, adopted from Bayen et al. (2000), consisted of 192 sentences that were presented visually only. The sentences were divided into three categories on the basis of their content: 64 doctor-related items, 64 lawyer-related items, and 64 profession-neutral items. Within each category, there were 32 target sentences (e.g. “Do you have any food allergies?”) and 32 distractor sentences that were identical to the targets, except for the modification of one or two words (e.g. “Do you have any drug allergies?”).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">During the study session, 96 items (i.e., 32 target sentences from each category) were presented simultaneously with a color photo of one of two middle-aged Caucasian male faces, labeled Bill or Tom. Each <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> was paired with 16 sentences from each of the three categories. An additional 6 filler items at the beginning and the end of the study phase were included so as to reduce primacy and recency effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The test phase consisted of 48 studied items intermixed with 48 distractor items (i.e., new items). Sixteen studied items were from each category, with an equal number associated with the sources Bill and Tom. Moreover, the new distractor items included 16 doctor sentences, 16 lawyer sentences, and 16 neutral sentences. There were an additional 6 practice items at the beginning of the test, which were used to demonstrate the task to participants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All study and test items were presented in a random order, with the constraint that no more than 3 items of a particular type could appear consecutively. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> program was created with E-prime Version 1.1 (2002), and the sentences and photos were presented on a 17-in. (43.2-cm) monitor. Finally, across participants, we counterbalanced (a) assignment of sentences to the target and distractor conditions and (b) assignment of sentences to both sources.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The study items were presented in an incidental manner. Participants were told that they would see a series of sentences, and each would be associated with a person, Bill or Tom, represented by the individual's picture. They were asked to rate how easily they could imagine the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong>, either Bill or Tom, saying the sentence. Responses were made on a keyboard with a 5-point Likert scale to identify the difficulty of imagining the sentences. No mention was made of the subsequent <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> test. Presentation proceeded at the rate of one sentence every 3.5 s, and participants were asked to make their imageability response before this time elapsed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After viewing the study items, participants were told about the surprise <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> test. However, before the test began, they were informed that it would be helpful for them to know that one speaker was, in fact, a lawyer, and the other was a doctor. Participants were told that the test would consist of studied sentences as well as new sentences that had not been encountered earlier. All test items appeared visually at the top of the screen, with either the old–new question (i.e., “Was this sentence presented by one of the sources earlier?”) or the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> question (i.e., “Who originally presented this statement. Was it Bill or Tom?”) appearing 3 cm below the test item. Pictures of the two sources were shown underneath the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> question in the center of the screen with their name and assigned profession (e.g., “Bill, lawyer”) below the corresponding picture.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the standard <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test condition, participants first determined whether the sentence was old (a previously presented item) or new. For test items receiving a response of old, participants then identified whether the sentence had been paired earlier with Bill or with Tom during the study phase. In the modified <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test condition, participants also first determined whether the sentence was old or new. For items receiving a response of old, participants decided whether the item was presented earlier by Bill or by Tom or whether they could not remember (i.e., don't know). During the test instructions, participants were told that it was important for them to respond Bill or Tom only if they vividly recollected the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> presenting the item during the study phase. Moreover, participants were warned not to guess and to select don't know if they could not distinctly remember who presented the item during the study phase. For every test item, the following reminder not to guess appeared at the bottom of the screen, “It's important that you don't guess. Only respond `Tom' or `Bill' if you specifically remember one of them presenting the statement, otherwise respond `don't know'.” In sum, the modified <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test and standard <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> test conditions were identical in every respect except for the don't know option and its associated instructions. In both conditions, participants progressed through the test at their own pace.</p>
