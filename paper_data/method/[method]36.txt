<h3>Study 5––Reduced Motivation or Increased Self-Handicapping?</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A remaining question concerns the source of the reduced preparative effects observed when upward counterfactuals concern a <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-handicap. Thus far, it has been argued that this effect occurs because excusing failure leaves the individual relatively more satisfied with the performance and thus less motivated to improve in the future. A growing literature has demonstrated that counterfactuals benefit future performance only when accompanied by negative affect (Markman &amp; McMullen, 2003; Markman et al., 2008; McMullen &amp; Markman, 2000; Myers &amp; McCrea, 2008). However, it is possible that the effects in the present studies are rather due to an increase in the motivation to <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-handicap on the subsequent task. <sup/> One could argue that counterfactuals mentioning the <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-handicap make this <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-protective strategy more cognitively accessible, consistent with past work demonstrating situational priming of goals (Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee-Chai, Barndollar, &amp; Troetschel, 2001). Alternatively, because the counterfactual mentioning the <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-handicap <strong data-auto="strong_text">excuses</strong> poor performance, the individual may continue to positively evaluate his or her ability and thus is motivated to continue protecting this <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-concept by <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">handicapping</strong> on subsequent tasks. In contrast, those who have not excused a poor performance would already suffer from lowered <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem and thus have nothing left to protect. <strong data-auto="strong_text">Self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">handicapping</strong> is reduced after failure feedback (Berglas &amp; Jones, 1978; Higgins &amp; Harris, 1988; Thompson, 2004) and is generally construed as an attempt to protect positive yet fragile <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-views (Harris &amp; Snyder, 1986; Jones &amp; Berglas, 1978). Study 5 was therefore designed to examine whether decreased task motivation or increased <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">handicapping</strong> motivation better accounts for the present effects. Participants were induced to practice insufficiently and assigned to consider either handicap-related upward counterfactual thoughts or control thoughts, as in Study 3. However, rather than assessing desire to engage in a behavior that could undermine performance (e.g., reduced subsequent practice or listening to distracting noises), participants' actual effort and performance on the task was measured. To assess motivation to <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-handicap, participants were told that performance on the second exam was undermined by high stress levels and that they would therefore be asked to complete a stress measure. A number of previous studies have shown that individuals will claim stress as a handicap, and both men and women are willing to <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-handicap in this manner (Hendrix &amp; Hirt, 2008; Hirt et al., 1991; McCrea &amp; Hirt, 2001). Thus, if the <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">handicapping</strong> account is correct, exposure to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-handicap-related upward counterfactuals should result in higher stress reporting but have no effect on task motivation, compared to control thoughts. In contrast, if the motivation account is correct, there should be no effects of counterfactual thought on stress reporting, but task effort and performance should be reduced after exposure to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-handicap-related upward counterfactuals.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 28 (14 women, 14 men) University of Konstanz students. They either were paid €5 or received credit in return for participation and were randomly assigned to one of two thought conditions (handicap vs. control) in a between-subjects design.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The design was adapted from Study 3. The observation of participants via camera was eliminated given that this manipulation proved unnecessary in Study 4. Participants completed the Rosenberg <strong data-auto="strong_text">Self</strong>-Esteem inventory as part of a prescreening measure. Upon arrival to the laboratory, they were told the experiment involved factors influencing math performance and completed a consent form. After receiving the practice instructions, participants completed an initial 2-min (insufficient) practice session, the first math exam, and received failure feedback. Following exposure to either the handicap-related (i.e., lack of practice) upward counterfactual thoughts or the control thoughts, participants were given instructions concerning a surprise second math exam. They were told that the second exam includes a time component and therefore is strongly affected by one's current ability to concentrate. Individuals experiencing stress in their lives can become distracted and, as a result, not perform as well. Participants were therefore asked to complete a 32-item stress inventory (adapted from Kanner, Coyne, Schaeffer, &amp; Lazarus, 1981). This measure served as an assessment of <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">handicapping</strong> (see also Hendrix &amp; Hirt, 2008; Hirt et al., 1991).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Following the stress inventory, participants began the second math exam. The number of items attempted and the number correctly answered in a 4-min period were recorded. Participants then completed manipulation checks as in previous studies.</p>
