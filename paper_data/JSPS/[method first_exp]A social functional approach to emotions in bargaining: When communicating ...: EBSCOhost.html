Concentrating on allocator behavior, participants were assigned the allocator role and were informed that chips were worth twice as much to them as to the recipient (cf. <a href="#c60">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000</a>). Half of the participants learned that the recipient knew about this differential value (i.e., symmetric information), and the other half learned that the recipient was unaware of this difference (i.e., asymmetric information). Before making their offer, all participants received information about the recipient's <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong> (either anger or happiness).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It may be noted that in the <a href="#c61">Van Kleef et al. (2004a</a>, <a href="#c62">2004b</a>) studies, the <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotions</strong> were expressed in reaction to the offers that participants made. After receiving the offer, the (simulated) opponents communicated that they were either angry or happy about the offer, and the main interest was in how this affected subsequent offers. Such a procedure would not be feasible in ultimatum <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong>, however, because in ultimatum <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> allocators only make one (take it or leave it) offer. Therefore, we adjusted the procedure by having the participants fill out a general six-item questionnaire to supposedly assess their general views on <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong>. Their answers were supposedly sent to the recipient, who then reacted with either anger or happiness. This slight adjustment not only sufficed to include a meaningful manipulation of <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong> in ultimatum <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong>, it also served to remedy a potential limitation of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong> manipulation of the Van Kleef et al. studies. One could argue that in the Van Kleef et al. studies, the manipulation of <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong> also constitutes a manipulation of how attractive the offer is to the opponent. That is, by responding in anger, the opponent basically states that the offer itself is highly unacceptable. By decoupling the <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong> manipulation from the actual offer, this alternative interpretation seems less viable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our first interest was in whether we would replicate the informational and behavioral findings that have been documented in earlier negotiation research (e.g., <a href="#c51">Sinaceur &amp; Tiedens, 2006</a>; <a href="#c61">Van Kleef, 2004a</a>, <a href="#c62">2004b</a>). Would similar effects of <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong> be observed in ultimatum <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong>? And would they be as evident in the case of symmetric information as in the case of asymmetric information? We anticipated two possibilities. The first possibility was that we would indeed find a similar effect such that participants make higher offers to angry opponents than to happy opponents. If the behavioral effects of communicated anger or happiness are primarily based on the informational effects of communicated <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotions</strong> on the perceived limits (i.e., angry opponents are expected to have higher limits than happy opponents), we should find two main effects. To make the offer acceptable, angry opponents should be offered more chips than happy opponents, and opponents should be offered more chips in the symmetric information conditions than in the asymmetric information conditions (<a href="#c25">Kagel et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#c40">Pillutla &amp; Murnighan, 1995</a>; <a href="#c53">Straub &amp; Murnighan, 1995</a>; <a href="#c60">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000</a>). An alternative possibility would be that participants in the asymmetric information condition might be reluctant to take advantage of their information advantage when confronted with a happy opponent. In that case, in the symmetric information conditions participants would offer more chips to the angry opponent than to the happy opponent, replicating the findings of <a href="#c61">Van Kleef et al. (2004a)</a>, whereas in the asymmetric information conditions participants would offer more chips to the happy opponent than to the angry opponent.</p><a id="psp-94-4-600-ID0ECDCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design and Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The study used a 2 (<strong data-auto="strong_text">emotions</strong>: angry vs. happy) × 2 (information: symmetric vs. asymmetric) between-participants factorial design. The participants, 114 students (42 men and 72 women) at Leiden University (mean age = 20.1 years), participated voluntarily.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">At the start of the instructions, the participants were informed that they would participate in a study on <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> and that they were paired with one of the other participants. Members of each dyad would be referred to as persons X and Y. All participants learned that they were assigned the letter X.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After this, participants were informed that before the <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> would start, they should answer some questions about how they viewed <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong>. For this purpose, participants were presented with six general statements, and they had to indicate on a 5-point scale to what extent they agreed or disagreed with the statements. Example statements are “Strategy is important in negotiations” and “In negotiations I quickly try to reach agreement.” It was only after answering these questions that participants learned that their answers would be sent to the person that they would bargain with. The fact that answers were sent to the opponent was explained by pointing out that in reality people often have some information about the other party.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants then received the explanation of the ultimatum <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> situation. All participants learned that they, X, would bargain with Y over the distribution of 100 chips; 1 chip was said to be worth .10 Euro to the allocator (person X) and .05 Euro to the recipient (person Y; 1 Euro equaled $1.20 at the time of the experiment). In all conditions, participants learned that they could make an offer for the distribution of the chips to the recipient. If the recipient accepted the offer, the chips would be divided accordingly. If the recipient rejected the offer, neither the recipient nor the allocator would receive any chips.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the asymmetric information conditions, participants were informed that the recipient did not know about the differential value and that only he or she knew that that chips were worth .05 Euro to the recipient. In the symmetric information conditions, participants learned that the recipient did know about the differential value of the chips.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After explaining the <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> situation, the manipulation of the recipient's <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong> was induced. Participants learned that the recipient had typed a reaction after reading the participant's six answers to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">bargaining</strong> statements. It was stressed that when the recipient typed the reaction, the recipient did not think that the typed reaction would be sent back to the participant (cf. <a href="#c61">Van Kleef et al., 2004a</a>). This was done to ensure that the participants trusted that the typed <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotion</strong> was genuine (rather than being a strategic message). In the angry recipient conditions, participants read, “I've read what X typed and I must say that I do get angry about it!!” In the happy recipient conditions, participants read, “I've read what X typed and I must say that it makes me happy!!”</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Subsequently, participants made their offer to the recipient. In addition, we performed some manipulation checks and assessed the <strong data-auto="strong_text">emotions</strong> (anger and happiness) that participants ascribed to the recipients and to themselves. Furthermore, we assessed the limits that participants ascribed to their opponent by asking them the minimum number of chips the recipient would need to accept their offer, and we asked them how likely it would be that the recipient would accept their offer. At the end of the experiment, participants were thoroughly debriefed and paid 6 Euro. All participants agreed to this procedure.</p><a id="psp-94-4-600-ID0EBDCAA"> </a>
