In this classic procedure of the cognitive dissonance literature, participants write a speech that goes against their own attitude, and when they perceive that they could have easily refused to write (high-choice condition), they tend to change their attitude in line with their speech, presumably to reduce the dissonance created by writing it (<a href="#c11">Festinger, 1957</a>). Participants who are simply told to write the speech with no room for refusal (low-choice condition) do not typically change their attitude as much.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We focused on the latter condition, reasoning that low-choice participants were similar to obedient observers of <strong data-auto="strong_text">moral</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong>: They are unquestionably going along with a behavior that goes against their own attitude and that, they believe, will have concrete negative consequences (<a href="#c6">Cooper &amp; Fazio, 1984</a>; <a href="#c33">Scher &amp; Cooper, 1989</a>). They have ample motive to stand up for their own attitude, and yet they do not. And we know from the results of high-choice conditions that without the safety blanket of the low-choice manipulation, they would feel a measure of discomfort associated with misrepresenting their true self. So how would they react to the news that another participant in the same condition refused to go along? As in the real-world examples presented above, we predicted that disinterested raters (<em>observers</em>) would like and admire a <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> standing up for his or her opinion more than an obedient other (Prediction 1b) but that participants who have themselves gone along with the problematic behavior (<em>actors</em>) by agreeing to write a counterattitudinal speech in a low-choice condition would instead reject the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> (Prediction 1a).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond this global <strong data-auto="strong_text">rejection</strong> (which we measured with liking and respect items), we wanted to document the nature of the impressions formed about the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong> by actors and observers, and in particular to document the role of agency and communion in the perception of <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong>. In the introduction, we posited that observers would see <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong> as strong individuals (higher agency), but not necessarily nicer than obedient others (no effect on communion), in line with Prediction 1b, whereas actors would definitely see <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong> as not very nice (lower communion) and not give them credit for being strong either (no effect on agency), in line with Prediction 1a. Compared with obedient others, <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebels</strong> should thus be rated higher on agency by observers (Prediction 1b), and lower on communion by actors (Prediction 1a).</p><a id="psp-95-1-76-ID0ECECAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Seventy undergraduates at a large U.S. private university (24 men, 35 women, 11 unreported) took part in this experiment in a laboratory setting in exchange for $10. Thirty-five first completed the <em>actor</em> version of the experiment, and 35 others were recruited 1 month later from the same population to complete the <em>observer</em> version.<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup> In both versions of the study, participants were randomly assigned to hearing a <em><strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong></em> or an <em>obedient</em> other, resulting in a 2 (actor vs. observer) × 2 (<strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> vs. obedient) between-subjects design. The experimenter was either a White man or a White woman.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants in the actor version took part in the low-choice version of an induced compliance paradigm (<a href="#c42">Zanna &amp; Cooper, 1974</a>). Under the guise of studying the relationship between perception of <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> and cogency of arguments, the experimenter told participants to make a speech in favor of eliminating the reading week (a class-free period preceding final examinations), a proposal that we knew was very unpopular in our participant population. To instantiate foreseeable aversive consequences (<a href="#c6">Cooper &amp; Fazio, 1984</a>), we told participants that the tapes would go to the “Undergraduate Committee on Curriculum,” which allegedly funded the project and would probably use the arguments when deciding on the reading week. Participants were given a few minutes to prepare their speech, recorded it on their own, completed some questionnaires, and were then introduced to the “<strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> perception” part of the experiment. In this section, they listened to a tape allegedly recorded by a previous participant in the same setting and used the scales provided (see the <em>Measures</em> section below) to indicate what they thought of the other person. The tape that they listened to contained the rebellion manipulation—in the obedient condition, the other complied, and in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">rebel</strong> condition, he or she rebelled (see the
<a href="#A">Appendix</a> for scripts of tapes).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the observer version, participants were given a detailed written description of the instructions (allegedly) received by the recorded speakers. These instructions matched the ones actually used with actors in the induced compliance paradigm. They then listened to the same audiotapes as actors did and rated the speaker, without making a speech of their own. In all conditions, the gender of the speaker was matched with that of the participant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Under the guise of investigating the relationship between <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> and cogency of arguments, participants rated the speaker on 14 7-point bipolar scales anchored on <em>stupid–intelligent</em>, <em>weak–strong</em>, <em>insecure–confident</em>, <em>passive–active</em>, <em>cruel–kind</em>, <em>awful–nice</em>, <em>cold–warm</em>, <em>dishonest–honest</em>, <em>unfair–fair</em>, <em>unpleasant–pleasant</em>, <em>dependent–independent</em>, <em>stingy–generous</em>, <em>immature–mature</em>, and <em>low self-esteem–high self-esteem.</em> Participants then indicated, on 7-point scales, ranging from −3 (<em>dislike very much</em>) to + 3 (<em>like very much</em>), how much they would like to work on a class project with the speaker, how much they would like the speaker as a friend, and how much they would like the speaker as a roommate. Then, they listed three <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> traits that came to their mind to describe the speaker, reported how much choice they thought they had in making the speech that they gave (actors only), indicated how much they respected the person on the tape on a 7-point scale ranging from −3 (<em>despise a great deal</em>) to +3 (<em>respect a great deal</em>), and finally estimated how the speaker felt about eliminating the reading week, on a scale ranging from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 11 (<em>strongly agree</em>).</p><a id="psp-95-1-76-ID0EBECAA"> </a>
