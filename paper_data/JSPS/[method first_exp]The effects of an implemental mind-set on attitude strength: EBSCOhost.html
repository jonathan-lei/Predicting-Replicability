An evaluatively two-sided perspective has the potential to obstruct the task of implementation because it gives conflicting behavioral cues. One way to avoid such conflict is to selectively process information about objects in a positive or negative direction (<a href="#c57">Nordgren, van Harreveld, &amp; Van der Pligt, 2006</a>). As an <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> is posited to transfer a general increase in <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">strength</strong> via selective information processing, this study assessed attitudinal extremity with an open-ended measure. Thought-listing is a key tool for assessing the degree of information processing (<a href="#c14">Cacioppo, von Hippel, &amp; Ernst, 1997</a>; <a href="#c41">Heckhausen &amp; Gollwitzer, 1987</a>). In the current experiment, we tested whether an <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> versus deliberative <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> leads to a more extreme (evaluatively one-sided) position toward a controversial issue.</p><a id="psp-94-3-396-ID0ECFCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 36 students (23 women, 13 men) enrolled in one of several <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> courses, who participated in partial fulfillment of a course requirement. The mean age for participants in this experiment and all remaining experiments was 19 years old. No gender or age differences emerged for any of the analyses reported. The sample for this experiment and all remaining experiments was restricted to participants who had never participated in any <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> experiments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure and Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were randomly assigned to a deliberative or <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> group, with 18 participants in each condition. We invited participants to a lab experiment dealing with the assessment of students' perspective toward different objects. Participants were ushered into separate experimental cubicles, with each cubicle equipped with a computer. Participants were informed that they would be engaging in two separate tasks during the course of the experiment. As a cover story, participants in all conditions were told that as a measure of relationship sensitivity, they would have the opportunity to write as though they were giving advice to others about how they should handle relationship problems. For this task, they would have a choice between two topics to write about (i.e., sexual inexperience and honesty issues in romantic relationships). The crucial difference was that depending on condition, participants were either asked to make this choice before (<strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong>) or after (deliberative <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong>) engaging in the second task.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the second task, which constituted the measure of interest, participants first read information about a controversial issue. After that, they wrote down their thoughts about this issue, and we calculated whether participants' thoughts about this unrelated issue were evaluatively one- versus two-sided. Note that while responding to the second task (<strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> measure), participants in the deliberative <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> condition expected to go back to the first task (romantic relationship advice) and receive more information in order to make their decision. Participants in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> condition, on the other hand, expected to go back to the first task and begin working on it (writing advice). In essence, participants in the deliberative <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> condition were interrupted in the midst of making their decision, whereas participants in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> condition were interrupted in the midst of preparing to carry out their decision.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em><strong data-auto="strong_text">Mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> manipulation</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We created a deliberative and <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> with the choice paradigm used in previous <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> research (e.g., <a href="#c3">Armor &amp; Taylor, 2003</a>; <a href="#c26">Fujita et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#c41">Heckhausen &amp; Gollwitzer, 1987</a>; <a href="#c65">Puca &amp; Schmalt, 2001</a>). Participants were asked to pick for themselves the relationship area (sexual inexperience or honesty) on which they felt more capable of giving advice. Participants in the deliberative <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> condition were told that the best way to find out which type of relationship area that they were better equipped to give advice on was to read letters that represented both areas. Participants were then led to believe that they would read one sample letter from each of the two problem areas in order to help them decide which area would allow them to give their best advice. Participants were then told that after they read both sample letters, they would choose the area on which they wanted to give advice. It was stressed to participants that they should hold off making their decision until they read both sample letters. Participants were then asked to indicate to the experimenter which sample letter (sexual inexperience or honesty) that they wanted to read first.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> condition were asked to choose the relationship area on which they wanted to give advice. Participants were told that if they considered themselves to be a person who gave better advice on issues related to either sexual inexperience or honesty in relationships, then they should choose that particular area on which to give advice. In contrast to deliberative <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> participants, <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> participants were not told that they would receive any sample letters in order to aid in their decision making. Rather, <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> participants were told that they would receive a sample letter after they had made their decision in order to help them prepare for giving advice to others.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We controlled for exposure to different information between our experimental conditions by having all participants read only one letter. Deliberative <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> participants who chose to receive the sexual inexperience (honesty) letter first and <strong data-auto="strong_text">implemental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">mind</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">set</strong> participants who chose to give advice on the sexual inexperience (honesty) area received a letter titled “Sample Sexual Experience Issue Letter” (“Sample Honesty Issue Letter”). The content of the letter was the same, regardless of participants' choice (see <a href="#A">Appendix A</a>). The letter contained elements of dishonesty and sexual inexperience, so it was believable that it represented the type of honesty or sexual inexperience issues for which people might ask for advice.<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Dependent measure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After reading the sample letter, participants were interrupted to do the second task, which was completing an <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> measure on an unrelated topic. All instructions for this task were given on the computer. As an introduction to this <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> questionnaire, participants were asked to provide their opinion on a topic that was supposedly being debated within the United States—whether the government should be allowed to read foreigners' e-mail.<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup> Specifically, participants read the following:
<blockquote>We are interested in getting your position on an issue that is being hotly debated within United States right now. How much access should the government (e.g., CIA, FBI) have to foreigners' e-mail? On the one hand, Americans believe that foreigners should be able to communicate without worrying about whether other people are spying on them and learning things about them that might be used to damage their reputation, career, or relationships. On the other hand, Americans want this kind of oversight because it helps protect the country from individuals and organizations that only want to hurt the country economically, physically, and emotionally.</blockquote> In order to reduce the likelihood that participants already held a strong <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> toward this issue, we restricted our sample to participants who were not foreigners. Participants were also told that their responses would be completely anonymous.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were asked to provide an open-ended response regarding their thoughts on the issue. We had two independent raters (both blind to condition) code how polarized each participant's position was toward the issue using the following system: Individuals who stated they were completely against the government allowing the reading of foreigners' e-mail received a code of –1. Individuals who stated they were against the government allowing the reading or foreigners' e-mail but also mentioned exceptions in which they would be in favor of it or mentioned the possibility of it being done in a way that they would favor received a code of 0. Individuals who stated they were in favor of the government allowing the reading of foreigners' e-mail but also mentioned exceptions in which they would not be in favor of it or mentioned the possibility of it being done in a way that they would not favor also received a code of 0. Finally, individuals who stated they were completely in favor of the government allowing the reading of foreigners' e-mail received a code of 1 (see <a href="#B">Appendix B</a> for examples of each coded response).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Agreement among raters was high (<em>r</em> = .89). Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Using the coding system, we created an index of whether participants expressed an evaluatively one-sided or two-sided <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> toward the issue. Specifically, we examined the number of participants in each condition who received a code of −1 or 1 and compared it with the number of participants who received a code of 0. This served as our main dependent variable. After responding to the open-ended question, participants answered demographic questions. Before proceeding back to the relationship task, participants were asked to recall the sample letter. After this memory check, participants were thoroughly debriefed and thanked.</p><a id="psp-94-3-396-ID0EBFCAA"> </a>
