The study was conducted in English during their “Introduction to <strong data-auto="strong_text">Social</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">Psychology</strong>” class. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions. Six students chose to not take part in the experiment. There were no gender differences in any of the results reported.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Induction of <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> style</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We induced <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">versus</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> in a way similar to the procedure used by <a href="#c39">Friedman et al. (2003)</a>. Specifically, a map of the inner city of Oldenburg, Germany, was projected on the screen of the lecture hall, and participants were asked to examine it for 3 min. In the <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> condition, participants were asked to look at the map as a whole so that they could answer later questions about the overall shape of the map. In the <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> condition, participants were asked to look at the details of the map so that they could answer later questions about them. In the control condition, participants were asked to focus on both details and shape.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Semantic priming</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The priming manipulation consisted of a word-search puzzle similar to the one used by <a href="#c2">Bargh and Gollwitzer (1994)</a> and <a href="#c79">Mussweiler and Förster (2000)</a>. In particular, we used two word-search puzzles, 19 letters × 17 letters, each with 12 words that were arranged horizontally and vertically. All 12 words were listed on the right-hand side of the letter matrix. Both puzzles included 6 words that were neutral with respect to aggression (<em>board</em>, <em>radio</em>, <em>roof</em>, <em>clock</em>, <em>newspaper</em>, <em>bread</em>). The neutral puzzle included another 6 neutral words (<em>teapot</em>, <em>colorful</em>, <em>calendar</em>, <em>barge</em>, <em>chair</em>, <em>cup</em>) and the aggression puzzle included 6 aggression-related words (<em>violence</em>, <em>hatred</em>, <em>brutal</em>, <em>murder</em>, <em>attack</em>, <em>malicious</em>) that were successfully used in other studies (e.g., <a href="#c79">Mussweiler &amp; Förster, 2000</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For our main dependent variable, we made use of <a href="#c92">Srull &amp; Wyer's (1979)</a> person perception task. In this task, participants read a paragraph about John, who is described as performing a number of ambiguously aggressive behaviors (e.g., denying a salesman entry into the apartment, refusing to pay rent until the landlord repainted the apartment). Previous research has shown that this paragraph is ambiguous with respect to its evaluative implications, as the target person may be perceived as either aggressive or assertive (e.g., <a href="#c92">Srull &amp; Wyer, 1979</a>; <a href="#c93">1980</a>). Participants then rated the target person on 10 bipolar scales, which ranged from 1 to 9, with endpoints labeled with antagonistic traits. The endpoints of the 2 critical scales, which appeared in the fifth and the eighth positions on the list, were labeled <em>assertive–hostile</em> and <em>determined–belligerent</em>. These 2 scales appeared along with 8 irrelevant scales (e.g., with endpoints labeled <em>self-confident–arrogant</em>, <em>cowardly–cautious</em>). The order of the traits was constant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants of an “Introduction to <strong data-auto="strong_text">Social</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">Psychology</strong>” class were asked to participate in an experimental session. The instructor announced a class demonstration of three different experiments on different psychological questions. He said that students were welcome to participate but could also choose not to participate. Participants were given four different folders. The first folder contained the general instructions. Here, participants were informed that they were about to take part in three separate studies, one on geographic abilities, one on cognitive performance, and one on person perception. It was pointed out that the three studies were unrelated and were administered together solely for efficiency reasons. The materials were printed in different fonts and on different types of paper.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second folder contained the alleged geographic abilities task to induce a <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">versus</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> style. Participants were asked to focus on a map of the city of Oldenburg that was projected on the screen of the lecture hall. One third of the participants were instructed to attend to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> shape, one third to attend to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> details, and one third was asked to attend to both the details and shape of the map. After 3 min of observing the map, the participants were asked to answer a questionnaire concerning the map that was intended to render credibility to the cover story but was not analyzed</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The third folder contained the semantic priming task, which was introduced as a pretest of materials that would later be used to examine cognitive performance. About half of the participants received the puzzle containing aggression-related words, whereas the other half received a puzzle containing no aggression-related words. Participants had 2 min to do the task, which none of the participants completed. We did this because a former study showed that priming effects are more likely to be effective if the priming task is interrupted (<a href="#c31">Förster, Liberman, &amp; Higgins, 2005</a>; <a href="#c58">Liberman, Förster, &amp; Higgins, 2007</a>; <a href="#c69">Martin, 1986</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The fourth folder contained the third impression formation task. Participants were informed that the purpose of the third study was to pretest materials for a study on <strong data-auto="strong_text">social</strong> perception. They were asked to read the description of John and to rate him on the 10 bipolar scales.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A final set of questions examined participants' awareness of the actual purpose of the study, which was discovered by none of them. After completing the tasks in the folders, participants were thanked and debriefed. A class discussion revealed that no one felt that one task influenced the next and that participants enjoyed taking part in the study. In sum, Experiment 1 was based on a 3 (<strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong>: <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> vs. <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> vs. control) × 2 (semantic priming: aggression vs. no aggression) between-participants factorial design.</p><a id="psp-94-4-579-ID0EAFCAA"> </a>
