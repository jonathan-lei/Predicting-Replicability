Their mean age was 19.0 years (<em>SD</em> = 1.7). The participants were randomly assigned to Form A (216 participants) and Form B (218 participants).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Experimental Tasks</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Base-rate problem</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a href="#c92">Kahneman and Tversky's (1973)</a> much-studied lawyer/engineer problem was employed as a probe of the degree of base-rate usage. The two versions were identical except that the base rates given for the engineers and lawyers were switched as a between-subjects variable (30 engineers and 70 lawyers in Form A and 70 engineers and 30 lawyers in Form B). Both groups responded by estimating the probability that the focal individual was one of the engineers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Framing problem (Asian disease)</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This item was based on <a href="#c185">Tversky and Kahneman's (1981)</a> famous disease problem. The positive (gain) and negative (loss) framing of the problem was a between-subjects manipulation (Form A was the gain frame and Form B was the loss frame). Both groups of participants chose a response on the following scale: “I strongly favor program A” (1); “I favor program A” (2); “I slightly favor program A” (3); “I slightly favor program B” (4); “I favor program B” (5); “I strongly favor program B” (6). Higher scored responses represented more risk seeking.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Conjunction problem</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This problem was based on <a href="#c187">Tversky and Kahneman's (1983)</a> much-studied Linda problem. Participants read the following: “Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and <strong data-auto="strong_text">social</strong> justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.”</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants then used a 6-point scale (1 = <em>extremely improbable</em>, 2 = <em>very improbable</em>, 3 = <em>somewhat probable</em>, 4 = <em>moderately probable</em>, 5 = <em>very probable</em>, 6 = <em>extremely probable</em>) to indicate the <strong data-auto="strong_text">relative</strong> probability of three statements that described Linda. The first two statements were identical for the two groups of participants as follows: 1) It is ______ that Linda is a teacher in an elementary school; 2) It is ______ that Linda works in a bookstore and takes Yoga classes. Each group then read one of two statements that differed in whether they did or did not contain a conjunction of two descriptions. Participants getting Form A read the following: 3) It is ______ that Linda is a bank teller. Participants getting Form B read the following: 3) It is ______ that Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Outcome bias</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our measure of outcome bias derived from a problem investigated by <a href="#c17">Baron and Hershey (1988)</a>. Participants receiving Form A read the positive outcome version involving a 55-year-old man who had a heart condition and whose operation succeeded. Participants evaluated the physician's decision to go ahead with the operation (1 = <em>incorrect, a very bad decision</em>; 2 = <em>incorrect, all things considered</em>; 3 = <em>incorrect, but not unreasonable</em>; 4 = <em>the decision and its opposite are equally good</em>; 5 = <em>correct, but the opposite would be reasonable too</em>; 6 = <em>correct, all things considered</em>; 7 = <em>clearly correct, an excellent decision</em>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants receiving Form B (negative outcome) evaluated a medical decision that was designed to be objectively better than the first: 2% chance of death rather than 8%; 10-year increase in life expectancy versus 5-year increase, etc. However, it had an unfortunate negative outcome—death of the patient.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Anchoring and adjustment problems</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The two problems used here were adapted from an anchoring and adjustment problem in <a href="#c183">Tversky and Kahneman (1974)</a> and one used by <a href="#c52">Epley and Gilovich (2004)</a>. Prior to making an estimation of a particular value, participants answered a question containing a small or large anchor value. The Form A version is given below, with the Form B value in brackets:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">1.

The mean reported verbal SAT score of the students was 577 (<em>SD</em> = 68), the mean reported mathematical SAT score was 572 (<em>SD</em> = 69), and the mean total SAT score was 1149 (<em>SD</em> = 110). The institution-wide averages for this university in 2006 were 565, 575, and 1140, respectively. Several studies have indicated that the correlation between self-reported SATs and verified SAT scores is in the range of .80 to .92 (<a href="#c33">Cassady, 2001</a>; <a href="#c111">Kuncel, Crede, &amp; Thomas, 2005</a>; <a href="#c126">Noftle &amp; Robins, 2007</a>) as is the correlation between self-reported and verified grade-point average (<a href="#c79">Higgins, Peterson, Pihl, &amp; Lee, 2007</a>). An indication of the validity of the self-reported scores is that they correlated with a third variable to the same extent as verified scores. <a href="#c166">Stanovich and West (1998c)</a> found that the correlation between a vocabulary test and self-reported SAT total scores (.49) was quite similar to the .51 correlation between the vocabulary test and verified total SAT scores in a previous investigation that used the same vocabulary measure (<a href="#c195">West &amp; Stanovich, 1991</a>). These indications of validity are perhaps consistent with the fact that participation in these experiments represents a low-stakes, anonymous situation in which participants have little reason to misrepresent their SAT scores (in contrast to a more high-stakes situation where a job or some other benefit may be on the line).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The total SAT score was used as an index of <strong data-auto="strong_text">cognitive ability</strong> in the analyses reported here because it loads highly on psychometric <em>g</em> (<a href="#c69">Frey &amp; Detterman, 2004</a>; <a href="#c191">Unsworth &amp; Engle, 2007</a>). For the purposes of some of the analyses described below, the 206 students with SAT scores below the median (1150) were assigned to the low-SAT group, and the 228 remaining students were assigned to the high-SAT group. Parallel analyses that are fully continuous and that did not involve partitioning the sample are also reported.<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One caveat concerning the associations in these studies relates to the restriction of range in our sample. Certainly, it is true that individuals with average and above average <strong data-auto="strong_text">cognitive ability</strong> are overrepresented in samples composed entirely of university students. Nevertheless, the actual range in <strong data-auto="strong_text">cognitive ability</strong> found among college students in the United States is quite large. In the past 30 years, the percentage of 25- to 29-years-olds in the United States who have attended college has increased by 50%. By 2002, 58% of these young adults had completed at least 1 or more years of college, and 29% had received at least a bachelor's degree (<a href="#c181">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2003</a>). However, the restriction of range in <strong data-auto="strong_text">cognitive ability</strong> is somewhat greater in our sample because our participants attended a moderately selective state university. The SAT total means of our samples are roughly .60 of a standard deviation above the national mean of 1021 (<a href="#c36">College Board, 2006</a>). The standard deviation of the distribution of scores in our sample is roughly .55–.70 of the standard deviation in the nationally representative sample.</p><a id="psp-94-4-672-ID0EAICAA"> </a>
