This should be the case regardless of whether people themselves tend to be vulnerable (i.e., low self-esteem). Thus, before testing the specific paths of the model in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, in Study 1, we tested whether people do associate interpersonal vulnerability with partners <strong data-auto="strong_text">walking</strong> on <strong data-auto="strong_text">eggshells</strong>.</p><a id="psp-95-2-420-ID0EBFCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One hundred and fifty-four participants (128 women, 24 men, 2 who did not report their gender; <em>M</em> age = 32 years) completed an electronic survey in exchange for entry into a $100 raffle.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures and Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants completed all measures in the order presented below.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Open-ended descriptions of reactions to an interpersonally vulnerable individual</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants read the following description of an individual who is especially insecure and emotionally vulnerable in regard to interpersonal acceptance:
<blockquote>Suppose that there is a person who appears to be very insecure. He or she appears to worry about what other people think about him/her. He/she often “reads into things,” thinking that other people see him or her negatively when they actually might not. His/her feelings are easily hurt and he/she often gets angry or upset with others.</blockquote> Then, they provided written responses to the prompts “In your own words, please describe how most people would act around such a person” and “Why do you think people act this way around this type of individual?”</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Perceptions of general authenticity with a vulnerable individual</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants read the description presented above and completed a 10-item measure assessing their perceptions of others' authenticity with this individual using 7-point response scales (1 = <em>strongly disagree</em>; 7 = <em>strongly agree</em>). The items included five that assessed authentic responses (i.e., “People would freely express any negative thoughts they have about this person,” “People would freely give this person negative feedback or criticism,” “People would be honest about how positively they view this person,” “People would not worry about upsetting this person,” and “People would not really think twice about what they say to this person”) and five that assessed inauthentic responses (“People would hide any negative thoughts they have about this person,” “People would be reluctant to give this person negative feedback or criticism,” “People would pretend that they view this person more positively than they actually do,” “People would be cautious about upsetting this person,” and “People would be overly careful not to say anything that would upset this person”). The order of items was determined randomly for each participant. Responses to items were averaged to create authentic responding (α = .68) and inauthentic responding (α = .81) indices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Perceptions of general authenticity with a secure individual</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were asked to imagine a secure individual using the following instructions:
<blockquote>Suppose that there is a person who appears to be very confident. He or she does not appear to be overly concerned about what other people think about him/her. He/she tends to assume that other people see him/her positively. He/she tends to not let what other people say bother him/her.</blockquote> Then, participants completed the same five authentic items (α = .79) and five inauthentic items (α = .81) described above.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Perceptions of specific authenticity with vulnerable individuals</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also included measures to assess the perceived likelihood of specific authentic and inauthentic responses in specific situations. Participants read the following three scenarios depicting interactions with interpersonally vulnerable individuals: “Imagine that someone is very sensitive about his/her appearance. On one particular day, this person doesn't look all that attractive”; “Imagine that someone is very sensitive about whether or not other people like him/her. This person tells a joke that is not very funny”; and “Imagine that someone is very sensitive about whether or not other people like him/her. This person says something that offends his/her friend.” For each scenario, two potential responses of the interaction partner were provided, one that was authentic and negative and the other that was inauthentic and more positive. Participants indicated the likelihood of an authentic response (i.e., “His/her boyfriend/girlfriend tells the truth and tells him/her that he/she doesn't look attractive,” “His/her friend doesn't laugh,” and “The friend tells this person that he/she was upset,” respectively) and an inauthentic response (i.e., “His/her boyfriend/girlfriend lies and tells him/her that he/she looks attractive,” “His/her friend forces a laugh, pretending that it was funny,” and “The friend says nothing to this person about the incident,” respectively) using 4-point rating scales (1 = <em>very unlikely</em>; 2 = <em>unlikely</em>; 3 = <em>likely</em>; 4 = <em>very likely</em>). Whether the authentic or inauthentic response was presented first was randomly determined for each participant and scenario.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Perceptions of specific authenticity with secure individuals</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The same scenarios as described above were presented again, except that the individual was depicted as secure (i.e., “Imagine that someone is not overly concerned about his/her appearance,” “Imagine that someone is not very worried about what other people think of him/her,” and “Imagine that someone is not overly concerned about what other people think of him/her,” respectively). Participants then completed the items described above assessing their perceived likelihood of authentic and inauthentic responses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Self-esteem</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants completed the <a href="#c72">Rosenberg (1965)</a> Self-Esteem Scale using 6-point response scales (1 = <em>strongly disagree</em>; 6 = <em>strongly agree</em>; α = .90).</p><a id="psp-95-2-420-ID0EAFCAA"> </a>
