Previous research has revealed that a commitment to a chosen course of action results in the increase of relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> activity (<a href="#c39">Harmon-Jones, Gerdjikov, &amp; Harmon-Jones, in press</a>). Moreover, this commitment (high-choice) caused attitudes to be more consistent with the behavior, as compared with a low-commitment (low-choice) condition. However, in past research, relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">activation</strong> did not relate to attitudes, perhaps because the attitude measure lacked the needed sensitivity (e.g., it did not tap attitude change from precommitment, but only tapped attitudes following the commitment).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In past research, when the psychological process (commitment to a chosen course of action) was manipulated and the proposed physiological substrate was measured (<strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">activation</strong>), commitment to a chosen course of action increased relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">activation</strong> (<a href="#c39">Harmon-Jones et al., in press</a>). To provide stronger causal inferences regarding the role of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> region in following through with the commitment (discrepancy reduction), it is important to manipulate the physiology and measure the psychological outcome. Manipulation of the mediator also provides stronger causal evidence than simply correlating the proposed mediator with the outcome (<a href="#c68">Sigall &amp; Mills, 1998</a>; <a href="#c72">Spencer, Zanna, &amp; Fong, 2005</a>). In Experiment 1, after participants made a difficult decision, participants' relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> activity was manipulated, and then attitudinal <strong data-auto="strong_text">spreading</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong> was measured.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To manipulate relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> activity, we used neurofeedback training of EEG, also called EEG biofeedback training. Neurofeedback presents the participant with real-time feedback on brainwave activity. The feedback can be presented in the form of a video display, vibration, or sound. If brainwave activity over a particular <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> region changes in the direction desired by the experiment, then the participant is given “reward” feedback; if brainwave activity does not change in the desired direction, then either negative feedback or no feedback is given. Rewards can be as simple as the presentation of a tone that informs the participant that brain activity has changed in the desired way. Neurofeedback-induced changes result from operant conditioning, and as such, these changes in EEG can occur without awareness of how the brain activity changes occurred (<a href="#c50">Kamiya, 1979</a>; <a href="#c70">Siniatchkin, Kropp, &amp; Gerber, 2000</a>). This is not to say that it is impossible for a participant to become aware of how she or he caused the changes in brain activity, but research suggests that such awareness requires extensive practice (e.g., 8 weeks of practice; <a href="#c53">Kotchoubey, Kübler, Strehl, Flor, &amp; Birbaumer, 2002</a>), whereas the changes in brain activity due to conditioning occur much more quickly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In past research with clinically depressed individuals, neurofeedback training was used to increase relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> activity, and it led to less depression after approximately 27 training sessions (<a href="#c5">Baehr, Rosenfeld, &amp; Baehr, 2001</a>). In other research with nondepressed individuals, neurofeedback was effective at decreasing but not increasing relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> activity after only 3 days of training. The decrease in relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> activity brought about with this brief neurofeedback training caused less approach-related emotional responses (<a href="#c1">Allen, Harmon-Jones, &amp; Cavender, 2001</a>). On the basis of these past results, we predicted that the decrease-<strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> condition would be more successful at changing brain activity than the increase-<strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> condition. Although past research with normal individuals revealed that brief neurofeedback failed to increase relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> activity, we included this condition to have a proper neurofeedback comparison condition for the decrease-<strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> condition and to give the increase-<strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> neurofeedback another chance to produce significant brainwave changes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Most important, we predicted that a decrease in relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> activity would lead to a decrease in discrepancy reduction as measured by <strong data-auto="strong_text">spreading</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong>. To test these predictions, we used the decision paradigm based on the one developed by <a href="#c12">Brehm (1956)</a>.</p><a id="psp-94-1-1-ID0ECCCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Overview</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants underwent 2 days of neurofeedback training designed to increase or decrease relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> activity. On the third day, after making a difficult decision, they underwent another neurofeedback training session of the same direction as previous days (increase vs. decrease <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong>). Finally, participants rerated their decision <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong>. We predicted a manipulated decrease, as compared with increase, in relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> activity would cause a reduction in <strong data-auto="strong_text">spreading</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Procedures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 33 female introductory <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> students who participated in exchange for extra credit toward their grade on Day 1 and then for $10 per hour on Days 2 and 3. On the basis of past research suggesting that neurofeedback of asymmetrical <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> activity produces effects after 3 consecutive days (<a href="#c1">Allen et al., 2001</a>), participants were administered 3 days of neurofeedback. They were randomly assigned to feedback designed to either increase or decrease relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> activity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After participants provided informed consent and were prepared for EEG recording on Day 1, their baseline EEG was collected for 8 min. Then, two 8-min blocks of neurofeedback occurred. On Day 2, four 8-min blocks of neurofeedback training occurred. For neurofeedback training, participants were told that the activity of their brains would cause a computer to generate tones and that they should try to make the tone stay on, in order to receive more payment. Participants were not told that neurofeedback was contingent on asymmetry. No explicit verbal feedback was provided to participants concerning their performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">On Day 3, after the experimenter greeted participants, she explained that the study would examine the relationship between <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> characteristics, brain activity, and preferences for different types of psychological research. She also explained that we conduct lots of research in the department but have never asked students how much they would like to participate in such research. She explained that students' preferences for the research may affect their responses in the experiments, so we need to know students' preferences and how <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> characteristics related to these preferences. She then said that because the study is short and will last only 20 min, she would have them participate in another study. Then, participants provided informed consent.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experimenter explained that in the first study, participants would complete short questionnaires that assess preferences for different types of psychological research. The experimenter then shuffled a set of index cards that contained descriptions of nine research projects (attention, attitudes and values, economics, health, law, linguistics, perceptual cognitive, perceptual motor, person perception).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The participants were given the cards and asked to read them in the order in which they were presented and to then rate each project in terms of how desirable it would be to participate in a study like the one described on a 9-point scale (1 = <em>not at all desirable</em>, 9 = <em>very desirable</em>). Participants were <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> alone to rate the projects. When the participants informed the experimenter over the intercom that they had completed the ratings, the experimenter returned to the participants' room and asked the participants to rank order the projects on a separate questionnaire. While the participants ranked the projects, the experimenter, who was in the adjacent room, examined the participants' ratings questionnaire and found which two projects had been rated equally and relatively positively (approximately seven on the 9-point scale), as has been done in other research (<a href="#c12">Brehm, 1956</a>; <a href="#c40">Harmon-Jones &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2002</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When the participants completed the rankings questionnaire, the experimenter returned to the participants' room and explained that some of the studies that were just rated were being conducted now. She then gave them a choice to participate in one of two studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After participants made their decision between two equally rated <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong>, four 8-min neurofeedback training sessions occurred. Then, the experimenter returned to the participant's room with the cards containing the research project descriptions. She explained that we were also interested in how familiarity with the research descriptions might affect ratings of the research projects. She explained that the <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> department was considering posting sign-up sheets that contain more information about the experiments. She explained that if this change occurred, then by the end of the semester, students may have read the names and descriptions of some research projects many times. She further explained that the <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> department wanted us to assess how reading the research descriptions repeatedly affects evaluations of the research. She then asked participants to rate their current preferences for the research projects again.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Afterward, participants completed a questionnaire that asked them to “explain what thoughts, feelings, etc. you had that caused the tone to be played during the biofeedback training session.” In the end, the experimenter questioned the participants about suspicion and explained the exact purpose of the experiment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>EEG Recording and Analyses</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To record EEG, five electrodes mounted in a stretch-lycra electrode cap (Electro-Cap, Eaton, OH) were placed on the participant's head using known anatomical landmarks (<a href="#c11">Blom &amp; Anneveldt, 1982</a>). EEG was recorded from midfrontal (F3/4) and parietal (P3/4) regions. The ground electrode was mounted in the cap on the mid-line between the <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> pole and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> site. The reference electrode was placed at the vertex (Cz), as done in past <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> asymmetry neurofeedback studies (<a href="#c1">Allen et al., 2001</a>). Vertical eye movements were recorded from the supra- and suborbit of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> eye to eliminate trials with eyeblinks. All electrode impedances were under 5,000 Ω, and homologous sites (e.g., F3 and F4) were within 1,000 Ω of each other. Electro-Gel (Eaton, OH) was used as the conducting medium. Signals were amplified with J&amp;J Engineering amplifiers (I-410; Poulsbo, WA), bandpass-filtered 1-35 Hz, and sampled at 256 Hz. Alpha power was computed, by bandpass filtering (8–13 Hz) and then rectifying the signals (1-s epochs). EEG alpha power over the <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> cortices is inversely related to activity over the same <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> regions measured using other methods such as positron emission tomography (<a href="#c18">Cook, O'Hara, Uijtdehaage, Mandelkern, &amp; Leuchter, 1998</a>), functional magnetic resonance imaging (<a href="#c26">Goldman, Stern, Engel, &amp; Cohen, 2002</a>), and behavioral methods (<a href="#c20">Davidson, Chapman, Chapman, &amp; Henriques, 1990</a>; <a href="#c57">Lindsley &amp; Wicke, 1974</a>). Recent source localization work has revealed that approach/withdrawal-related <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> EEG alpha asymmetry reflects dorsolateral prefrontal <strong data-auto="strong_text">cortical</strong> activity (<a href="#c62">Pizzagalli, Sherwood, Henriques, &amp; Davidson, 2005</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">On Day 1, baseline EEG was acquired for 8 min. After that period, a separate experimenter, who did not interact with the participant, computed the participant's mean <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> difference and standard deviation. This second experimenter was used so that the experimenter who interacted with participants was blind to condition. Then, this second experimenter used the mean and standard deviation to establish a criterion value for the next block of neurofeedback training. The criterion value was the mean of the previous block of EEG recording + 0.85 <em>SD</em> for participants in the <em>increase-<strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong></em> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> condition; it was −0.85 <em>SD</em> for participants in the <em>decrease-<strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong></em> condition. For Day 2, the criterion value was determined from the mean <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> difference and standard deviation of the last 16 min on Day 1. For Day 3, the criterion value was determined from the mean <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> difference and standard deviation from all of Day 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thus, for the neurofeedback training, the computer determined the difference in activity between <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> sites and compared this value against the criterion value established from a previous recording. If the difference exceeded the criterion value in the desired direction, then a tone was played over headphones. If it was not exceeded, then no tone was played. Participants were instructed to attempt to produce the tones. Epochs for which ocular activity exceeded 50 μV resulted in no tone for the next 2 s. Similar to past research (<a href="#c1">Allen et al., 2001</a>), the criterion values resulted in reinforcement on approximately 20% of trials, and the rate of reinforcement was equivalent across days and groups. In other words, there were no differences between experimental conditions in the participants' abilities to achieve the criterion, and thus, the conditions were equally difficult.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Rationale for Certain Design Issues</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The effect of difficult decisions on <strong data-auto="strong_text">spreading</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong> has been demonstrated in hundreds of experiments (for reviews, see <a href="#c13">Brehm &amp; Cohen, 1962</a>; <a href="#c24">Festinger, 1964</a>; <a href="#c41">Harmon-Jones &amp; Mills, 1999</a>; <a href="#c85">Wicklund &amp; Brehm, 1976</a>). In addition, published experiments found significant <strong data-auto="strong_text">spreading</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong> in difficult but not easy decision conditions, using the same decision paradigm as used in the present experiments (<a href="#c40">Harmon-Jones &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2002</a>). Thus, following much recent research on <strong data-auto="strong_text">spreading</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong> (e.g., <a href="#c48">Hoshino-Browne et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#c75">Steele, Spencer, &amp; Lynch, 1993</a>), we did not include easy decision conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Past neurofeedback studies have not included a “no-feedback” condition because of the difficulties in making no-feedback conditions comparable to neurofeedback conditions (e.g., <a href="#c1">Allen et al., 2001</a>; <a href="#c5">Baehr et al., 2001</a>; <a href="#c30">Hardman et al., 1997</a>; <a href="#c65">Roberts, Birbaumer, Rockstroh, Lutzenberger, &amp; Elbert, 1989</a>). To be comparable to neurofeedback conditions, a no-feedback condition would need to include “feedback” tones, and participants would need to be told that their brainwaves were producing the tones. It is likely that such sham feedback and instructions will not be neutral to participants. Because of the robustness of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">spreading</strong>-of-<strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong> effect following difficult decisions in “neutral” conditions, we did not include a no-neurofeedback-training condition in the present experiment. If the neurofeedback-induced manipulation of relative <strong data-auto="strong_text">left</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> activity caused differences in <strong data-auto="strong_text">spreading</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong>, then the results would support the predictions derived from the action-based model. The question of whether the neurofeedback training caused increased versus decreased <strong data-auto="strong_text">spreading</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">alternatives</strong> relative to a no-feedback condition was not important for the test of this theory-derived prediction. Rather, the question we wanted to address was, “Does a manipulated change in <strong data-auto="strong_text">frontal</strong> asymmetry affect the degree of dissonance reduction?” Also, given the concerns about the difficulty of creating a comparable no-feedback condition, such a condition was not included.</p><a id="psp-94-1-1-ID0EBCCAA"> </a>
