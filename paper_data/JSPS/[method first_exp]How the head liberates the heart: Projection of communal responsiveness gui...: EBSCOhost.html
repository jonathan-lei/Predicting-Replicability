We also tested whether changes in mood could explain these effects.</p><a id="psp-94-4-647-ID0EBFCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were recruited via advertisements on Internet bulletin boards for participation in an electronic survey in exchange for entry in a $100 raffle. The 96 participants included 15 men and 81 women (<em>M</em> age = 34.89 years). After completing a series of questions not relevant to the current research, participants completed the remainder of the survey in regard to a romantic partner if they were currently in a romantic relationship (<em>n</em> = 72) and in regard to a close friend if they were not currently in a romantic relationship (<em>n</em> = 24). Participants randomly assigned to the neutral condition (<em>n</em> = 48) completed an open-ended question in response to the following prompt: “Think of a time when you were with this person and nothing unusual happened. That is, think of a time you spent together that was typical of the time you usually spend with this person. Vividly imagine the situation and then describe what happened on the lines below.” Participants randomly assigned to the unresponsive condition (<em>n</em> = 48) instead completed an open-ended question in response to the following prompt: “Think of a time when you treated this person badly. For example, you may have done or said something that hurt this person's feelings, you may have neglected this person's needs or desires, or you may have been unpleasant. Vividly imagine the situation and then briefly describe what happened on the lines below.” All participants then completed the dependent measures described below.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Own responsiveness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants' own felt responsiveness to the partner's needs was assessed with a three-item measure (“I would sacrifice a lot for this person,” “I care about this person,” “I would go out of my way to help this person”) answered on 6-point response scales (1 = <em>strongly disagree</em>, 6 = <em>strongly agree</em>; α = .90).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Perceived partner responsiveness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants' perceptions of the partner's responsiveness was assessed with an analogous three-item measure (e.g., “This person would go out of his/her way to help me”) answered on identical response scales (α = .86).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Evaluation of partner</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants' evaluations of the partners were assessed with a nine-item measure (“This person treats others kindly”; “This person is well-liked by others”; “This person is cruel to others”; “This person is a person of worth, at least on an equal basis with others”; “This person has a number of good qualities”; “I take a positive attitude toward this person”; “This person treats others with respect”; “This person has more shortcomings and flaws than the average person”; “This person does not have much to be proud of”) completed using identical response scales. Responses to negatively worded items were reverse scored (α = .92).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Mood</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants indicated the extent to which they presently felt six emotions (afraid, angry, happy, sad, alert, and content) using 5-point response scales (1 = <em>very slightly or not at all</em>, 5 = <em>extremely</em>). After we reverse scored responses to the negative emotions, we averaged responses to create an index of mood (α = .67).</p><a id="psp-94-4-647-ID0EAFCAA"> </a>
