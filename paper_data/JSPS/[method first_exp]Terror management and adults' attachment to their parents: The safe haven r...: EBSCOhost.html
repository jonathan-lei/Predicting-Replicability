<h4>Study 1</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If secure images of parental <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> offer protection from death-related concerns, activating positive cognitive representations of one's mother should attenuate the delayed increase in death-thought accessibility that has been found to follow reminders of death. To examine this possibility, in Study 1 we randomly assigned participants to a 2 (MS: death vs. dental pain) × 4 (parent prime: positive parent, negative parent, positive acquaintance, or neutral acquaintance) factorial design, and we measured the accessibility of death-related thoughts with a word stem completion task. If <strong data-auto="strong_text">parents</strong> fulfill an anxiety-buffering role for their adult offspring, then people should complete fewer death-related words following a manipulation that emphasizes positive support from one's mother. To ascertain whether any activation of parental representations would attenuate post MS death-thought accessibility, we also included a condition in which participants were asked to visualize a critical, negative interaction with a parent. Finally, to assess whether the predicted effects are specific to activating thoughts of one's mother and not just a positive interaction with another person, we included a condition in which participants were asked to write about a positive interaction with a recent acquaintance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Participants</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One hundred and forty-three students (92 women and 50 men; 1 person did not report his or her age and gender but was included) from two universities participated in exchange for course credit. Ages ranged from 17 to 54 years (<em>M</em> = 21.81, <em>SD</em> = 6.71).<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Materials and Procedure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants completed a packet of materials described as a <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> assessment. All questionnaires were identical except for the MS and parent prime manipulations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Mortality salience</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To maintain the cover story, we included in all packets filler questionnaires and then, following previous research (<a href="#c99">Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &amp; Lyon, 1989</a>), we randomly assigned participants to answer questions related to either death or another aversive topic. In the MS conditions, the questions were “Please briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouse in you” and “Jot down, as specifically as you can, what you think will happen to you as you physically die and once you are physically dead.” In the control condition, participants were asked parallel questions about experiencing dental pain. This has been the most commonly used aversive thought control condition, and prior research has shown that it yields results similar to other aversive thought control conditions concerning topics, such as uncertainty, upcoming exams, and <strong data-auto="strong_text">social</strong> exclusion, and similar to neutral control conditions as well (e.g., <a href="#c70">Landau et al., 2004a</a>, <a href="#c71">2004b</a>; <a href="#c101">Routledge, Arndt, &amp; Goldenberg, 2004</a>; <a href="#c104">Schimel et al., 1999</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Delay–distraction</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Evidence suggests that distal MS effects occur when thoughts of death are highly accessible but outside of conscious awareness (<a href="#c94">Pyszczynski, Greenberg, &amp; Solomon, 1999</a>). Therefore, we asked participants to complete the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; <a href="#c121">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988</a>) and a word search task to provide a 3- to 5-min delay. The word search puzzle was a 10 × 10 matrix of letters with instructions asking people to search and circle 10 neutral words (e.g., <em>book</em>, <em>movie</em>). We used the PANAS in subsequent analyses to determine whether MS influenced people's mood, although previous research indicates that it typically does not (see, e.g., <a href="#c55">Greenberg, Solomon, &amp; Pyszczynski, 1997</a>).<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Parent prime</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second independent variable consisted of a visualization task based on <a href="#c11">Baldwin and Sinclair's (1996)</a> research. Specifically, participants were asked to imagine either a negative or positive interaction with a parent. In the positive condition participants were told “Please write about a time where your mother expressed a positive opinion of you. That is, write about a time when your mother was nonevaluative and simply accepted your for who you are.” In the negative condition, participants were instructed to consider a time where their mother held a “somewhat negative opinion” and “was very evaluative and accepted you only to the extent that you lived up to certain standards.” As in Baldwin and Sinclair, participants in a third control condition were asked to write about a recent acquaintance (i.e., “someone you recently met”). Finally, we included a fourth condition wherein participants were asked to write about a positive interaction with a recent acquaintance. The instructions were identical to the positive parent condition except the word <em>mother</em> was replaced with <em>someone you recently met</em>. In all conditions, students were instructed to visualize being in the presence of this person (i.e., to imagine the person's eye color, hair color, sound of his or her voice) and to express their thoughts and feelings associated with this person by writing for the length of a page.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Death-thought accessibility</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We used a word stem completion task to measure the accessibility of death-related thoughts; this served as the dependent variable. This task is similar to those used in other research (e.g., <a href="#c15">Bassili &amp; Smith, 1986</a>; <a href="#c51">Gilbert &amp; Hixon, 1991</a>; <a href="#c114">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</a>; <a href="#c119">Tulving, Schacter, &amp; Stark, 1982</a>) and presents participants with 25 word fragments, 5 of which could be completed with a neutral or death-related word. This measure has been used successfully in a many <strong data-auto="strong_text">terror</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">management</strong> studies (e.g., <a href="#c53">Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, &amp; Breus, 1994</a>; <a href="#c81">Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 2000</a>). Examples of the neutral words include TAB _ _ (<em>table</em>), _ _ OK (<em>book</em>), and WAT _ _ (<em>water</em>). The death completions were DE _ _ (<em>dead</em> or <em>deed</em>), GRA _ _ (<em>grave</em> or <em>grape</em>), SK _ _ L (<em>skull</em> or <em>skill</em>), COFF _ _ (<em>coffin</em> or <em>coffee</em>), and KI _ _ ED (<em>killed</em> or <em>kissed</em>). Death accessibility scores were the total number of death-related word completions.</p>
