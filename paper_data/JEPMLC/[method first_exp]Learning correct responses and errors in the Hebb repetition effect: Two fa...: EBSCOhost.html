All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal audition and vision.</p><a id="xlm-34-3-524-ID0EBCCAA"> </a><h4>Material</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The ISR task was programmed with Microsoft Visual Basic (Version 6.0). At each trial, nine letters were played to the participant through headphones at a rate of one letter per second (700 ms On, 300 ms Off) at approximately 65 dB(A). The items were recorded in a French female voice and edited with Sound Forge (Version 7.0; <a href="#c29">Sony Corporation, 2003</a>). The same set of monosyllabic letters was used over trials (<em>D</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>, <em>K</em>, <em>L</em>, <em>N</em>, <em>Q</em>, and <em>R</em>); only the order of presentation changed from trial to trial. After each sequence, the nine letters were randomly presented horizontally within a 17- × 17-cm frame on a computer screen, and participants had to give their <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> by using a mouse to click on the letters. Each letter changed from black to green when selected and remained that way until the end of the trial.</p><a id="xlm-34-3-524-ID0EACCAA"> </a><h4>Design and Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The sequence heard on Trial 4 was presented 12 times during the experiment, once every four trials. There were three novel randomly generated sequences between each <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> of the critical sequence, forming 12 blocks of four trials. Two practice trials preceded the 48 <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trials (12 repeated sequences and 36 novel sequences). The critical repeated sequence was randomly chosen for each participant. Participants were told to memorize all the items they heard in the same order in which they were presented and to try to reproduce the <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> sequence in the recall phase. Participants received no feedback on their <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong>. No other instructions were given and, of course, no cues about the repeating sequences were provided. Participants were tested individually.</p><a id="xlm-34-3-524-ID0EBCAA"> </a>
