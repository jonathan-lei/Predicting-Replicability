Versions of this task have been used to investigate the efficiency with which various sorts of cognitive processes can be stopped, and so performance on the task can be considered to diagnose the individual efficiency of actively inhibiting one's “thoughts and actions” (<a href="#c37">Logan, 1994</a>; <a href="#c38">Logan &amp; Cowan, 1984</a>). In our version of the task, participants responded to the direction of a green arrow by pressing a button with the left or right index finger. The stop signal was a sudden and unpredictable change of the arrow to red, which signaled a deliberate effort to refrain from responding. The performance in the stop signal paradigm can be conceptualized in terms of a race, in which the stop process and the go process compete to finish first (see <a href="#c38">Logan &amp; Cowan, 1984</a>). If the stop process finishes before the go process <strong data-auto="strong_text">does</strong>, the response is inhibited. By contrast, if the go process finishes before the stop process <strong data-auto="strong_text">does</strong>, the response is executed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To be successful, inhibitory processes have to win a race against concurrent response processes. If the inhibitory processes finish before the response processes do, the response is aborted. The stop signal reaction time (SSRT; see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) can be computed as an index of inhibitory efficiency (<a href="#c37">Logan, 1994</a>). If bilinguals are better inhibitors than monolinguals are, they should show significantly shorter SSRTs than monolinguals do.<br /><br /><a id="fig2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/667cbbef16891a6cdeae2a0f7c17da7e/5ebcb1ba/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-2-302-fig2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-302-fig2a.gif" title="Figure 2.

All reported having normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and all were unfamiliar with the purpose of the experiment. Half of the participants were monolingual Spanish speakers who lived in Spain, and the other half were Dutch–English bilinguals who lived in the Netherlands. All participants were tested by the same instructional protocols, although the actual testing was carried out in two different countries. The bilingual participants grew up in “mixed” families (with one parent speaking Dutch and the other speaking English or German), and some of them had lived part of their life in an English-speaking country. They used both Dutch and English on a daily basis throughout their lives. As research with bilingual adults (<a href="#c34">Kroll &amp; Stewart, 1994</a>) and children (<a href="#c4">Bialystok, 1988</a>) has revealed that the cognitive and linguistic consequences of <strong data-auto="strong_text">bilingualism</strong> are more salient for those bilinguals who are relatively balanced in their proficiency, we considered only balanced bilinguals for the present study. The monolingual Spanish speakers were not functionally fluent in any other language, despite the inevitable language courses in school. All participants in both groups attended university and shared similar middle-class socioeconomic backgrounds, and they were matched for age, gender, and IQ (measured by Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices; see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>).<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/5837fbf49cf1703f9a36fa933c9a2834/5ebcb1ba/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-2-302-tbl1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-302-tbl1a.gif" title="Demographic Data Measures and Standard Deviations for the Monolingual (Mon) and Bilingual (Bil) Groups" /><em>Demographic Data Measures and Standard Deviations for the Monolingual (Mon) and Bilingual (Bil) Groups</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus and stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The Spanish participants were tested with a laptop PC (Asus A3Ac with a 15.1-in. monitor), and the Dutch participants were tested with a desktop PC (Switch attached to a Philips 17-in. Real Flat monitor). Responses were made by pressing the <em>Z</em> or <em>?</em> keys of the <em>QWERTY</em> computer keyboard with the left and right index finger, respectively. Participants were required to react quickly and accurately by pressing the left or right key in response to the direction of a left- or right-pointing green arrow (choice trials) about 3.5 × 2.0 cm in length.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment consisted of a 30-min session, in which participants completed a version of the task adopted from <a href="#c56">van den Wildenberg et al. (2006)</a>. Arrows were presented pseudorandomly, with the constraint that they signaled left- and right-hand responses equally often. Arrow presentation was response terminated. Intervals between subsequent choice signals varied randomly but equiprobably, from 1,250 ms to 1,750 ms in steps of 125 ms. During these interstimulus intervals, a white fixation point (3 mm in diameter) was presented. The green arrow changed to red during 30% of the trials, upon which the choice response had to be aborted (stop trials). We used a staircase-tracking procedure that dynamically adjusted the delay between the onset of the choice signal and the onset of the stop signal for each hand separately to <strong data-auto="strong_text">control</strong> inhibition probability (<a href="#c36">Levitt, 1971</a>). After a successfully inhibited stop trial, stop signal delay increased by 35 ms in the next stop trial, whereas when the participant was unable to stop, the stop signal delay decreased by 35 ms in the next stop trial. This algorithm ensured that motor actions were successfully inhibited in about half of the stop trials, which yielded accurate estimates of SSRT (<a href="#c3">Band, van der Molen, &amp; Logan, 2003</a>; see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). The algorithm compensated for differences in choice RT between participants, between stimulation conditions, and between the left and right hands. The stop task consisted of five blocks of 104 trials, the first of which served as a practice block and allowed us to obtain stable participant performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Language background questionnaire</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To check whether our selection criteria had been met, we asked bilingual participants to fill out a questionnaire on language use and fluency in their two languages. The questionnaire addresses the percentage usage of each language at home, at work, with friends, and overall, and the responses indicate the extent to which each language is used daily and the degree to which the participant is functionally bilingual. The self-evaluated proficiency scores of the Dutch–English bilinguals are shown in <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>. Following the procedure used by <a href="#c13">Costa, Kovacic, Franck, and Caramazza (2003)</a>, we obtained the proficiency scores by a self-evaluation through the questionnaire the participants had filled out before the experiment. The scores are on a 10-point scale, in which 10 represents native-speaker level and 1 represents complete ignorance of the language. Other studies have shown that similar self-report measures correspond well with performance measures of proficiency, such as RT on a verbal categorization task (<a href="#c17">Dufour &amp; Kroll, 1995</a>; <a href="#c33">Kroll, Michael, Tokowicz, &amp; Dufour, 2002</a>).<br /><br /><a id="tbl2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/6decdb9a1f8ba51fa95bdad1a9e71940/5ebcb1ba/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-2-302-tbl2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-302-tbl2a.gif" title="Self-Evaluated Proficiency Scores of the Dutch–English Bilinguals" /><em>Self-Evaluated Proficiency Scores of the Dutch–English Bilinguals</em></span></p><a id="xlm-34-2-302-ID0EBDCAA"> </a>
