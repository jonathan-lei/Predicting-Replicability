They were randomly assigned to the forget or control group.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong data-auto="strong_text">Two</strong> lists of 16 medium-frequency nouns were created. Half of the List 1 words contained the letter <em>E</em> and half did not. List 1 was split into <strong data-auto="strong_text">two</strong> blocks of 8 items that were encoded with the same orienting task (either pleasantness judgment or letter <em>E</em>). Blocked presentation was employed to avoid frequent task switching and floor recall of List 1 weak items. The presentation order of the strong versus weak blocks was counterbalanced. Also, each word was assigned to the pleasantness task or the letter <em>E</em> task equally often. On List 2, half of the words rhymed with the word <em>seven</em> and half did not. All List 2 items were encoded with the same orienting task involving rhyming.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were informed that the purpose of the study was to design word norms for materials for a later experiment (cover stories are available on request). They were told that if a smiley-face icon appeared under a word, they were to indicate if it was pleasant or not (strong items), and if the letter <em>E</em> appeared under a word, they were to indicate if the word contained an <em>E</em> (weak items). Items were presented once at a rate of 4 s per word.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong data-auto="strong_text">After</strong> the first list, half of the participants were told that they would need to rate <strong data-auto="strong_text">one</strong> more list (further termed the <em>control group</em>). The remaining participants were told to forget the first list before moving on to rate the second list (further termed the <em>forget group</em>). They were told,
<blockquote>The list of words you just rated was the first list that we need to collect ratings for. Could you please rate one more list of words? However, it is really important that you not be influenced by your prior ratings. Therefore, please make an effort to try and forget those words and pretend you did not rate anything. Try not to think of the earlier words in order not to contaminate the judgments on these new items.</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Then the second list of 16 items was presented. List 2 words were judged for whether or not they rhymed with the word <em>seven</em>. The choice of the rhyming task was based on pilot testing because when both lists were processed with the same orienting task, the recall of the List 1 weak items was at floor. A surprise written free recall test was given afterwards on List 1, followed by List 2. Recall was carried out on separate sheets of paper for each list, with 90 s allotted for the recall of each list. <strong data-auto="strong_text">After</strong> the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> test, participants were asked whether they suspected that their <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> would be tested.</p><a id="xlm-34-2-408-ID0EADCAA"> </a>
