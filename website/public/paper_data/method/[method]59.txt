<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Study 3</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the next study, we succeeded in collecting more direct evidence for our main assumption that the differential information search in the 2- versus 10-information condition is based on different salient selection criteria, and, in addition, we tested whether the 2- versus 10-information effect could also alternatively be due to dissonance processes. </span><span class="sentence">From the perspective of dissonance theory, the effect of information quantity on the preference for consistent versus inconsistent information could emerge as follows: When people are confronted with only 1 inconsistent and 1 consistent piece of information, then (a) the potential for dissonance arousal and threat is comparatively low because only 1 piece of inconsistent information exists for the decision maker (Frey, 1986), and (b) refuting that 1 piece of inconsistent information is the most efficient way to reach long-lasting dissonance reduction (cf. Festinger, 1964; Frey, 1986). </span><span class="sentence">If the only existing piece of inconsistent information can be refuted, no further sources of potential dissonance arousal remain. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast, conditions with more than 1 inconsistent piece of information should lead to (a) a comparatively higher degree of postdecisional dissonance because several inconsistent pieces of information exist and (b) a refutation strategy that is an ineffective way of achieving dissonance reduction because even if 1 inconsistent piece of information were refuted, several pieces of nonrefuted inconsistent information would still remain (because in our classic paradigm, decision makers can only choose 1 piece of additional information). </span><span class="sentence">As a consequence, selecting a consistent piece of information should be the most efficient way to achieve dissonance reduction in conditions with more than 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent piece of information.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Instead of the dissonance explanation, we propose an alternative explanation that is based on different selection criteria. </span><span class="sentence">This alternative explanation is derived from the hypothesis that information search follows the minimum-effort principle and, therefore, decision makers try to select the piece of information that best differentiates among all available pieces of information. </span><span class="sentence">If there is more than one selection criterion that fits this description, decision makers choose the one that requires the least processing effort. </span><span class="sentence">In the 2-information condition, information direction completely distinguishes between both available pieces of information and requires less cognitive effort than assessing the information quality of the pieces of information individually. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, decision makers’ information search should be guided by information direction, which, however, triggers individuals’ desire to be and/or appear self-critical and unbiased (Kunda, 1990; Pyszczynski &amp; Greenberg, 1987) and thus leads to a systematic preference for inconsistent information. </span><span class="sentence">However, given that more than 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent piece of decision-relevant information exist, information direction no longer completely differentiates the available pieces of information. </span><span class="sentence">Hence, decision makers should switch to the cognitively more demanding assessment of information quality as the crucial selection criterion. </span><span class="sentence">However, because previous research has shown that consistent information is generally assessed to be of higher quality than inconsistent information (Ditto &amp; Lopez, 1992; Ditto et al., 1998; Fischer et al., 2005; Schulz-Hardt et al., 2007), in conditions with more than 2 available pieces of information, individuals are expected to systematically prefer a consistent piece of information.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The following research design, which varies as to whether in the 2- versus 10-information condition information content is given or not, helps to empirically distinguish between both the dissonance explanation and the selection-criteria explanation: If the 2- versus 10-information effect is due to different selection criteria, and therefore partially based on biased assessment of information quality in the condition with 10 pieces of information, then removing information content as a possible selection criterion––which means that evaluation of information quality is no longer possible––should reduce the preference for consistent information in that condition. </span><span class="sentence">However, if the 2- versus 10-information effect is due to dissonance processes, it should make no difference whether participants are provided with both information direction and detailed information content or with information direction only (without information content), because dissonance arousal is mostly a function of information direction (i.e., whether the information is consistent or inconsistent with one’s own standpoint). </span><span class="sentence">In short, the manipulation of information content should have no impact on the 2- versus 10-information effect if it is due to dissonance processes. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast, it should eliminate the preference for consistent information in the 10-information condition, as that effect is partially based on the biased assessment of information quality (i.e., different selection criteria).</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">One hundred and nine (81 women and 28 men, ages ranged from 18 to 55 years; <em>M</em> = 26.07, <em>SD</em> = 6.74) undergraduate and graduate students from Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany, participated in this experiment. </span><span class="sentence">All participants were recruited in the university cafeteria by asking whether they would be willing to participate in a study on decision making at the nearby Department of Psychology. </span><span class="sentence">The experiment was based on a 2 (information quantity: 2 vs. 10) × 2 (information content: given vs. not given) factorial between-subject design. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In Study 3, we employed a personnel decision case that has also been used in previous experiments on selective exposure (cf. Fischer et al., 2005). </span><span class="sentence">The participants were asked to imagine themselves in the role of a fashion store owner and to decide whether the contract of a manager (Mr. Miller) should be extended or not. </span><span class="sentence">They received a questionnaire containing an introduction to the topic and the most important facts about Mr. Miller’s work: Mr. Miller had been hired to manage a fashion store 1 year ago. </span><span class="sentence">Mr. Miller’s contract had been limited to a 1-year term; after that year, negotiations were to be conducted to discuss a possible extension of the contract. </span><span class="sentence">The participants were told that the success of Mr. Miller’s work was mixed. </span><span class="sentence">For example, he had succeeded in gaining new customers for the store by introducing a new product line (“Young Fashion”). </span><span class="sentence">However, at the same time, some of the store’s regular customers had been lost because they did not accept Mr. Miller’s “Men’s Fashion” collection. </span><span class="sentence">Positive and negative aspects of Mr. Miller’s work were balanced overall. </span><span class="sentence">After participants had read these facts, they were asked to make a preliminary decision as to whether Mr. Miller’s contract should be extended or not (participants were also informed that following their information search, they would have the opportunity to revise their decision at the end of the experiment).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Afterward, participants were informed that additional information concerning the decision problem was available (which would help them to make their final decision). </span><span class="sentence">The additional pieces of information consisted of either 2 or 10 one-page statements written by Mr. Miller’s colleagues. </span><span class="sentence">Each statement was summarized by a main thesis of two sentences. </span><span class="sentence">The main thesis contained the main argument of the corresponding statement and made it obvious whether the expert was in favor of or against an extension of the contract. </span><span class="sentence">Irrespective of whether the participants were in favor of or against an extension of the contract, half of the statements (either 1 or 5) supported their decision and the other half conflicted with it. </span><span class="sentence">Accordingly, the experimental manipulation of information quantity took place according to the number of statements presented (2 vs. 10).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Moreover, the factor Information Content was manipulated as follows: The short description of the available pieces of information contained either both the information direction and the corresponding main argument (information content given) or only the information direction without any explanation (information content not given). </span><span class="sentence">An example of a piece of information with information content provided is as follows: “Mr. Miller has made the best out of the current difficult economic situation. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, his contract should be extended.” </span><span class="sentence">An example of a piece of information with no information content provided is as follows: “Mr. Miller’s contract should not be extended.” </span><span class="sentence">In the first case, participants could use two different selection criteria, namely information quality (inferred from the argument “Mr. Miller has made the best of the currently difficult economic situation”) and information direction (apparent in the statement “Mr. Miller’s contract should be extended”). </span><span class="sentence">In the latter case, information direction (“Mr. Miller’s contract should not be extended”) was the only possible selection criterion. </span><span class="sentence">After information selection, participants made a final decision on whether the contract of the manager should be extended or not. </span><span class="sentence">After the experiment was over, all participants were debriefed, informed why it was not necessary to read the selected pieces of information, and given a cup of coffee and a chocolate bar as a token of our thanks for their participation.</span></p>
