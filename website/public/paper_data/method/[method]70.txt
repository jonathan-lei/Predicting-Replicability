<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Experiment 2: Global Versus Local Processing, Moderate Standards, and Subjective Versus Objective Scales</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In this experiment, we induced global versus local processing by making participants attend to either large or small letters, respectively. </span><span class="sentence">In an allegedly unrelated task, they were asked to compare their own alcohol consumption with one of two celebrities who constituted either a moderately high standard (the British pop singer Robbie Williams) or a moderately low comparison standard (the former tennis star Steffi Graf). </span><span class="sentence">Without prior activation of processing styles, we expected participants to assimilate self-evaluations toward the moderate standards on the objective scale and contrast away from the standards on the subjective scale, as found by Mussweiler and Strack (2000). </span><span class="sentence">We expected global processing to tilt the balance toward assimilation and local processing to tilt the balance toward contrast. </span><span class="sentence">We also wanted to examine whether global versus local processing would override the effect of subjective versus objective scales, so that after local processing there would be a contrast effect on both scales, whereas after global processing there would be an assimilation effect on both scales.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Mussweiler and Strack's (2000) SAM explains the effect of scale type by suggesting that with objective scales, accessible knowledge affects judgment, whereas subjective scales are used as a reference point to anchor the judgment of comparison. </span><span class="sentence">Biernat and Manis's (2007) model on stereotypes also predicts assimilation on objective scales and contrast on subjective scales. </span><span class="sentence">According to the authors, this occurs because objective scales evoke comparison to the entire population, and information about the group is used to interpret the target (e.g., “She is a woman; therefore, she probably has high verbal skills”). </span><span class="sentence">Contrary to that, subjective scales evoke more local comparisons within the group (e.g., “For a woman, her verbal skills are not that high”).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">As mentioned before, we hypothesized, in line with IEM, that subjective scales would enhance contrast because the target and the standard are used to define the range of the scale on which they obviously occupy opposite ends. </span><span class="sentence">We believed, however, that if one took enough of a global perspective, then a value range wider than that defined by the target and the standard might be considered, thus allowing for inclusion and assimilation. </span><span class="sentence">We also thought that it might be possible that a local perspective would narrow the range of values around the target and the standard, and would thus produce exclusion and contrast, even with objective scales. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, we thought that both types of scales might produce both assimilation, if processed globally, and contrast, if processed locally. </span><span class="sentence">The next study examined these predictions.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were 124 undergraduate students (62 women, 62 men) at the University of Bremen majoring in disciplines other than psychology who were recruited for an experimental session described as consisting of diverse psychological tests. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to conditions, tested in groups of up to 3 in sessions lasting approximately 2 hr, and paid 16 euros for participation.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We conducted a pretest to examine common attitudes about drug consumption among a number of rock, pop, and hip hop singers, and selected the British pop singer Robbie Williams, a well known celebrity in Germany, as our moderately high standard of drug consumption.  We conducted yet another pretest in which a different group of 20 participants estimated how often they and a number of celebrities engaged in a variety of behaviors. </span><span class="sentence">The critical questions pertained to the number of times the targets consumed drugs and alcohol within 1 month. </span><span class="sentence">On average, participants reported consuming drugs and alcohol about 10 times a month. </span><span class="sentence">Participants estimated that Robbie Williams (the high standard) consumes drugs and alcohol about 20 times a month, whereas Steffi Graf (the low standard) consumes drugs and alcohol about once to twice a month.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">There were three questions about drug and alcohol consumption, gauging comparative, objective, and subjective estimates. </span><span class="sentence">One third of the participants were first asked whether they consumed drugs, including alcohol, more or less often than Robbie Williams (i.e., the high standard). </span><span class="sentence">The other third were asked whether they consumed drugs and alcohol more or less often than Steffi Graf (i.e., the low standard). </span><span class="sentence">One third of the participants did not answer a comparative question. </span><span class="sentence">In the subsequent objective judgment, all the participants were asked to estimate the number of times they consumed drugs and alcohol per month. </span><span class="sentence">Finally, using a rating scale that ranged from 1 ( <em>not at all extensive</em>) to 9 ( <em>very extensive</em>), all the participants indicated how extensive their drug and alcohol consumption was.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Upon arrival of the participants, the experimenter handed out the materials of the two studies and pointed out that they were unrelated to each other and were administered together for efficiency reasons. </span><span class="sentence">Participants first completed the global–local processing task (Navon, 1977), which was administered on a computer and which presented a series of global letters (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) that were formed with local letters (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm; i.e., each horizontal or vertical line making up a global letter was formed with five closely spaced local letters). </span><span class="sentence">On each trial, participants were first presented with a fixation cross (+) in the center of the screen for 500 ms. </span><span class="sentence">Then, one of eight global composite letters was randomly presented, and participants were instructed to press a blue response key if the stimulus contained the letter <em>L</em> and to press a red response key if the stimulus contained the letter <em>H</em>. </span><span class="sentence">They were asked to respond as quickly as possible. </span><span class="sentence">The task was set up so that by random assignment, one third of the participants always had to detect a global letter (global processing condition), one third of the participants always had to detect a local letter (local processing condition), and one third of the participants had to detect global and local letters equally often (control processing condition). </span><span class="sentence">More specifically, in the global processing condition, each set of composite letters included eight global targets (an <em>H</em> made of <em>F</em>s, an <em>H</em> made of <em>T</em>s, an <em>L</em> made of <em>T</em>s, and an <em>L</em> made of <em>F</em>s) and no local targets, whereas in the local processing condition, each set included eight local targets (an <em>F</em> made of <em>H</em>s, an <em>F</em> made of <em>L</em>s, a <em>T</em> made of <em>H</em>s, and a <em>T</em> made of <em>L</em>s) and no global targets. </span><span class="sentence">In the control processing condition, four of the composite letters included global targets (an <em>H</em> made of <em>F</em>s, an <em>H</em> made of <em>T</em>s, an <em>L</em> made of <em>T</em>s, and an <em>L</em> made of <em>F</em>s) and four local targets (an <em>F</em> made of <em>H</em>s, an <em>F</em> made of <em>L</em>s, a <em>T</em> made of <em>H</em>s, and a <em>T</em> made of <em>L</em>s). </span><span class="sentence">Participants worked on a total of eight sets of composite letters: 48 global, 48 local, or 24 global and local trials each.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants then received a folder with instructions on the social comparison task, modeled after the task used by Mussweiler (2001) and Mussweiler and Strack (2000). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were first informed that the purpose of this study was to pretest materials for future studies on self-evaluation. </span><span class="sentence">They were told that in order to obtain normative data for these studies, the experimenter would ask them a number of questions about drug consumption. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told that before evaluating themselves, they would compare themselves to a celebrity: They were asked to bring this person to mind and to compare themselves with this person with respect to drug and alcohol consumption. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were encouraged to take some time to make this comparison. </span><span class="sentence">To ensure that participants did indeed engage in the respective comparisons, the experimenter asked them to indicate how difficult it was for them to make the comparison, using a scale ranging from 1 ( <em>very easy</em>) to 9 ( <em>very difficult</em>). </span><span class="sentence">There were no differences in experienced difficulty across conditions. </span><span class="sentence">Then, participants answered the two critical questions, one subjective and one objective question assessing self-evaluations of drug and alcohol consumption. </span><span class="sentence">The order of the two questions was counterbalanced and had no effects. </span><span class="sentence">This procedure was similar to that of Mussweiler and Strack (2000). </span><span class="sentence">After completion of the two tasks, participants were asked to perform other unrelated tasks, fully debriefed after the entire session, paid, and thanked for their participation. </span><span class="sentence">In sum, Experiment 2 was based on a 3 (processing: global vs. local vs. control) × 2 (standard: high vs. low) × 2 (scale: subjective vs. objective) factorial design, with only the last factor manipulated within participants.</span></p>
