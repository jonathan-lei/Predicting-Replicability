<h3>Experiment 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that near <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> neighbors have an inhibitory effect and distant <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> neighbors have a facilitative effect on visual word processing. To test this hypothesis, we selected four sets of items and independently manipulated the number of near and distant neighbors while matching the items on all other criteria.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 1 results suggested that SND effects would emerge more strongly in a <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> task than in a lexical decision task but that items such as foods are ambiguous with respect to their status as a living thing. To avoid this problem while still using a <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> task, we used a concreteness judgment task in Experiment 2 (participants were instructed to indicate whether or not it was possible to touch the thing named on the screen). This task is less susceptible to ambiguity than the living thing task and all of the critical words referred to concrete things (see Table 4 for mean concreteness values for each condition; these values are on a 100–700 scale taken from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database; Wilson, 1988). In addition, there is some evidence that the use of a broad category makes for a more difficult <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> decision, thus encouraging more <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> processing and allowing <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> effects to emerge more clearly (Hino, Pexman, &amp; Lupker, 2006). Consistent with this claim, in Experiment 1 we found stronger SND effects in the living thing judgment task relative to the lexical decision task, though the convergent results in the two tasks suggest that <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">neighborhood</strong> effects are relatively robust across tasks. The experiment began with 30 practice trials (with feedback; 15 concrete, 15 abstract trials) to familiarize participants with this task. Stimulus presentation details were the same as Experiment 1.<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/5df58c45d81872d5ab8ad388c3d9463f/5ebcaf09/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-1-65-tbl4a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-65-tbl4a.gif" title="Experiment 2 Critical Item Condition Means (and SDs) for Critical and Control Variables"/><em>Experiment 2 Critical Item Condition Means (and SDs) for Critical and Control Variables</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Twenty-five critical items were selected for each of four conditions: 2 (Many or Few Near Neighbors) × 2 (Many or Few Distant Neighbors). Near neighbors were defined as having cosine greater than 0.5, distant neighbors were defined as having cosine less than .25 and greater than 0.0. For near neighbors, “many” was defined as at least 2, and “few” was defined as 0 or 1; for distant neighbors, “many” was defined as more than 200, and “few” was defined as less than 150. These thresholds were chosen because they divided the corpus of words into four relatively equal groups with very different <strong data-auto="strong_text">neighborhood</strong> properties, and each of the groups was big enough to allow selection of a subset for matching on various control variables. This manipulation produced items with different near and distant <strong data-auto="strong_text">neighborhood</strong> sizes as measured by cosine distance but equivalent <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> neighborhoods as measured by number of associates and mean COALS <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">density</strong> (see Table 4). In addition, conditions were matched on word frequency, familiarity, AoA (AoA data [Gilhooly &amp; Logie, 1980; Stadthagen-Gonzalez &amp; Davis, 2006] were available for only 30% of the words), length (in terms of letters, phonemes, and syllables), orthographic <strong data-auto="strong_text">neighborhood</strong> (Coltheart's <em>N</em>), number of semantically congruent orthographic neighbors, and number of <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> features, with approximately equal numbers of creatures, fruits and vegetables, and nonliving things in each condition. Control variables (including number of associates and COALS SND) did not differ reliably between conditions either in terms of analysis of variance main effects or interactions or in terms of pairwise comparisons. Condition means for critical and control variables are in Table 4, and the 25 words in each critical condition are in Appendix B. To balance the critical “yes” trials, we chose 100 filler words (“no” trials) from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Wilson, 1988) based on low (less than 400, values range from 100 to 700) concreteness and imageability scores (<em>M</em>concreteness = 295; <em>M</em>imageability = 346) and matched to the critical words on length and frequency.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Twenty-two undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut completed the experiment for course credit.
