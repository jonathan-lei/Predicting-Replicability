<h3>Experiment 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that near semantic neighbors have an inhibitory effect and distant semantic neighbors have a facilitative effect on visual word processing. </span><span class="sentence">To test this hypothesis, we selected four sets of items and independently manipulated the number of near and distant neighbors while matching the items on all other criteria.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Experiment 1 results suggested that SND effects would emerge more strongly in a semantic task than in a lexical decision task but that items such as foods are ambiguous with respect to their status as a living thing. </span><span class="sentence">To avoid this problem while still using a semantic task, we used a concreteness judgment task in Experiment 2 (participants were instructed to indicate whether or not it was possible to touch the thing named on the screen). </span><span class="sentence">This task is less susceptible to ambiguity than the living thing task and all of the critical words referred to concrete things (see Table 4 for mean concreteness values for each condition; these values are on a 100–700 scale taken from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database; Wilson, 1988). </span><span class="sentence">In addition, there is some evidence that the use of a broad category makes for a more difficult semantic decision, thus encouraging more semantic processing and allowing semantic effects to emerge more clearly (Hino, Pexman, &amp; Lupker, 2006). </span><span class="sentence">Consistent with this claim, in Experiment 1 we found stronger SND effects in the living thing judgment task relative to the lexical decision task, though the convergent results in the two tasks suggest that semantic neighborhood effects are relatively robust across tasks. </span><span class="sentence">The experiment began with 30 practice trials (with feedback; 15 concrete, 15 abstract trials) to familiarize participants with this task. </span><span class="sentence">Stimulus presentation details were the same as Experiment 1.</span><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-1-65-tbl4a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-65-tbl4a.gif"/><em>Experiment 2 Critical Item Condition Means (and SDs) for Critical and Control Variables</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Twenty-five critical items were selected for each of four conditions: 2 (Many or Few Near Neighbors) × 2 (Many or Few Distant Neighbors). </span><span class="sentence">Near neighbors were defined as having cosine greater than 0.5, distant neighbors were defined as having cosine less than .25 and greater than 0.0.
