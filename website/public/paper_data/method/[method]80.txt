<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">EXPERIMENT 2</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">In Experiment 1, participants cheated more frequently on a simple arithmetic task after reading an essay that refuted the notion of free will than after reading a neutral essay. </span><span class="sentence">Moreover, reading the anti-free-will essay reduced participants' belief in free will, a change that accounted for the impact of the essay on cheating behavior.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Although the evidence in Experiment 1 is strong statistically, the way in which cheating was operationalized clouds interpretation of the results. </span><span class="sentence">Recall that cheating behavior was measured by the number of instances in which participants allowed answers to math questions to appear when they were supposed to be calculating the answers mentally. </span><span class="sentence">Although this is a well-validated method of assessing cheating (von Hippel et al., 2005), note that simply doing nothing is coded as cheating. </span><span class="sentence">Hence, the anti-free-will essay may have induced passivity generally, rather than immoral behavior specifically. </span><span class="sentence">Although participants were instructed to press the space bar to avoid receiving the answers, their failure to do so—counted as cheating—may not have been deliberately unethical.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Experiment 2 addressed this limitation by using a task that required active behavior in order to cheat (Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely, 2007) and that made clear the moral ramifications of an infraction. </span><span class="sentence">We also included a condition intended to strengthen free-will beliefs so that we could systematically test our hypothesis about the relation between strength of free-will beliefs and moral behavior. </span><span class="sentence">Finally, to bolster confidence in the interpretation of our results, we added conditions in which we obtained participants' scores on the task when they could not cheat.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Method</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>Participants</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants were 122 undergraduates (46 females, 75 males, 1 participant who did not specify gender). </span><span class="sentence">Data from 3 participants were unusable: One participant was a friend of the experimenter, and in two cases in which participants had the opportunity to cheat, only 1 person arrived at the experiment, which meant that a sense of anonymity was absent (see the next paragraph).</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Procedure</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions, in three of which cheating was possible. </span><span class="sentence">In the cheating-possible conditions (namely, the free-will, determinism, and neutral conditions), participants arrived at the laboratory in groups of 2 to 5, but were immediately shown to individual carrels, where they performed all tasks individually. </span><span class="sentence">This arrangement promoted a sense of anonymity, which was relevant for the cheating opportunity. </span><span class="sentence">In the two noncheating conditions, participants reported to the laboratory individually and were not given an opportunity to cheat.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">In the cheating-possible conditions, participants first completed a task, similar to one used by Velten (1968), that involved reading and considering a series of statements meant to change beliefs or feelings. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were given a booklet of 15 statements (1 per page) and were asked to think about each statement for 1 min before turning the page. </span><span class="sentence">A tape-recorded voice indicated when to turn the page.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Belief in free will was manipulated by varying the content of the statements. </span><span class="sentence">In the <i>free-will</i> condition, participants read statements such as, “I am able to override the genetic and environmental factors that sometimes influence my behavior,” and “Avoiding temptation requires that I exert my free will.” </span><span class="sentence">In the <i>determinism</i> condition, participants read statements such as, “A belief in free will contradicts the known fact that the universe is governed by lawful principles of science,” and “Ultimately, we are biological computers—designed by evolution, built through genetics, and programmed by the environment.” </span><span class="sentence">In the <i>neutral</i> condition, participants read statements such as, “Sugar cane and sugar beets are grown in 112 countries.” </span><span class="sentence">The neutral statements came from Velten's (1968) original method, whereas we created the free-will and determinism statements. </span><span class="sentence">After participants read and pondered all of the statements, they completed the FWD scale (Paulhus &amp; Margesson, 1994) and the PANAS (Watson et al., 1988).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">We then orchestrated an opportunity to cheat (e.g., Mazar et al., 2007). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were given a set of 15 reading-comprehension, mathematical, and logic and reasoning problems taken from the Graduate Record Examination practice tests. </span><span class="sentence">This type of task has been used previously to present subjects with a challenging but solvable set of problems (Schmeichel, Vohs, &amp; Baumeister, 2003). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told that the experimenter was investigating people's enjoyment of tasks when they receive feedback and rewards for performance, and hence that they would receive $1 for each problem they solved correctly.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">At this point, the experimenter looked at her cellular telephone and announced that she had suddenly realized she had a meeting to attend. </span><span class="sentence">She indicated that participants should work for a maximum of 15 min, and then score their own problems and pay themselves $1 for each correct answer. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter motioned to several answer sheets and a manila envelope containing $1 coins. </span><span class="sentence">She told participants to use the mechanical shredder to shred their answer sheets because she did not have permission to keep the sheets. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter left the room but waited outside to debrief participants as they exited. </span><span class="sentence">Although this procedure did not allow us to determine individual participants' scores on the task or the amount of money each participant paid him- or herself, we were able to calculate the average payment per participant, and this average served as a proxy for each participant's number of correct answers.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Two comparison conditions, labeled <i>baseline experimenter-scored</i> and <i>determinism experimenter-scored</i>, enabled us to measure veridically the number of questions that participants answered correctly (i.e., when participants were not in the self-scoring, self-payment situation). </span><span class="sentence">In the baseline experimenter-scored condition, participants simply completed the cognitive problems, which the experimenter scored; participants then received $1 for each correct answer. </span><span class="sentence">We did not ask participants in this condition to complete the FWD scale so as not to activate the concept of free will. </span><span class="sentence">In the determinism experimenter-scored condition, we gave participants the determinism statements and then the logic problems. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter scored the problems and paid participants $1 for each correct answer. </span><span class="sentence">This comparison condition allowed us to assess whether reading the scientific-sounding determinism statements had the incidental effect of aiding in solving the logic problems.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Thus, there were three comparison conditions we could use to examine the effects of the determinism and free-will manipulations on cheating: a neutral condition, in which participants were allowed to cheat but were not exposed to statements that might change their beliefs about free will; a baseline experimenter-scored condition, in which participants' true scores on the cognitive task were calculated without any manipulation; and a determinism experimenter-scored condition, in which participants read deterministic statements but were not allowed to cheat, so that their true scores on the problem set were known.</span></p>
