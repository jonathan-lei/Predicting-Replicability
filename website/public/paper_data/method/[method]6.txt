<h3>Experiment 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In Experiment 2, we corroborated the results of Experiment 1 by using the same–different task with numbers in Arabic and Indian notations. As mentioned earlier, a CDE was found in the physical same–different task of Dehaene and Akhavein (1995) only for same-<strong data-auto="strong_text">notation</strong> pairs and not for different-<strong data-auto="strong_text">notation</strong> pairs. As acknowledged by the authors, the absence of a CDE for the latter might be explained at least in part by the fact that an Arabic number and a number word are highly dissimilar perceptually, and this enabled participants to respond quickly to the task, leaving little opportunity for the irrelevant <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> value to affect performance. The use of two sets of <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> symbols in Experiment 2 was expected to make the physical same–different task harder and to enable exploring the presence of a CDE under less speeded conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It should be noted that the same–different and the comparisons tasks, although similar, each provide a unique piece of information, as the latter provides information on the numbers cardinality, whereas the former provides information about the numbers ordinality.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There was a procedural difference between these tasks. In the former, the stimuli were presented on the screen until the participant's response, whereas in latter task, used by Dehaene and Akhavein (1995), the stimuli were presented for 200 ms. To test the effect of exposure duration, we presented the number pairs on the screen for 200 ms for half of the participants in Experiment 2, whereas for the other half, we presented the numbers pairs on the screen until the participant's response. All participants performed both the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> and the physical same–different tasks.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thirty-two students of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel) or Achva Academic College (Israel) participated in the experiment. All of them were native speakers of Arabic who studied in a Hebrew-speaking academic institute. They participated either for course credits or payment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stimuli set was created following the method of Experiments 1 and 2 of Dehaene and Akhavein (1995). The 12 <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> pairs were composed of the Digits 1, 2, 8, and 9. There were three categories of <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference in this set: pairs with zero <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference (11, 22, 88, 99), pairs with a <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference of 1 (12, 21, 89, 98), and pairs with a <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference of 6 and larger (18, 19, 28, 29, 81, 91, 82, 92). In the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> same–different task, to equalize the frequency of trials from each difference category, the pairs with the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference of 0 were presented four times each, the pairs with the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference of 1 were presented four times each, and the pairs with the large <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference were presented twice each, thus creating a block of 48 trials. Each number was about 13 mm high and 9 mm wide. The distance between the centers of the digits was 6.5 mm. Each number in each pair could be presented in either Arabic or Indian <strong data-auto="strong_text">notation</strong>. There were thus three notations: Arabic, Indian, and Mixed notations (including both Arabic–Indian and Indian–Arabic pairs), creating an <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> set of 48 × 4 = 192 trials. Following Dehaene and Akhavein, to prevent participants from focusing exclusively on the Numbers 1, 2, 8, and 9, we added 72 distracting trials using the Digits 3–7. The distracting trials were not analyzed. Please note that the frequency of “same” responses in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> same–different task was 33% in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> set, but it was 48% in the whole set (including the fillers).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the physical same–different task, the four pairs with a <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> distance of 0 in both the Arabic and Indian notations appeared eight times because of a programming error instead of four times as in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> comparison task. Thus, the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> set included 224 instead of 192 trials, with 29% being “same” responses. With the additional 106 filler trials, the frequency of “same” responses was 40%. In any case, the critical comparison was always within the “different” trials, thus making the difference in the percentage of “same” and “different” responses less important.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The apparatus was identical to that of Experiment 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment was conducted individually. Each participant performed both the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> and the physical same–different tasks, with the order of tasks counterbalanced <strong data-auto="strong_text">across</strong> participants. The participant sat about 50 cm from the computer screen. The trial started with a fixation cross that appeared at the center of the screen for 500 ms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> same–different task, participants were instructed to decide whether the two numbers were the same in terms of their values, irrespective of notations. In the physical same–different task, participants were instructed to decide whether the two numbers were physically identical. In both tasks, they had to press the “A” key for a “same” response and the “L” key for a “different” response. A few examples of same-<strong data-auto="strong_text">notation</strong> and different-<strong data-auto="strong_text">notation</strong> pairs were presented following the instructions for each task along with the correct responses. Participants were required to respond as fast as possible but to avoid errors. There was a short rest break between the two tasks as well as after each sequence of 112 trials. For 16 participants, the numbers in both tasks were flashed for 200 ms, and for the rest, they remained on the screen until the participant's response.</p>
