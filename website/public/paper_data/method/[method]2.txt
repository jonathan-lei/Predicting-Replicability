<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The aim of Experiment 1 was to replicate Stark and McClelland's (2000) finding of priming for items judged new and then apply the model to the data. </button><button class="sentence">An experimental replication was conducted rather than simply fitting the model to Stark and McClelland's data because robust demonstrations of priming in the absence of awareness remain elusive, and independent replications of such effects are therefore important. </button><button class="sentence"> We presented words at study using the CID procedure; participants pressed a button when they could identify the word and then named the word aloud. </button><button class="sentence">At test, we presented old and new words to participants using the CID-R procedure.</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Twenty-four individuals were recruited through a University College London participant database. </button><button class="sentence">Their ages ranged from 19 to 38 years, with a mean of 23.3 years. </button><button class="sentence">All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision, reported English as their first language, were tested individually in sound-dampened cubicles, and were paid £4 (approximately $7) in return for taking part. </button><button class="sentence">The experiment was fully automated, and the experimenter was not present in the room during the course of the experiment.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">A total of 120 words were selected with similar constraints to Stark and McClelland (2000): All words had four letters, had a frequency of occurrence of 10–200 per million (Kucera &amp; Francis, 1967), and had a maximum score of 500 on the Imagability and Concreteness scales in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981). </button><button class="sentence">All words were presented in white 20-pt Courier font. </button><button class="sentence">Two 50-word lists were constructed. </button><button class="sentence">Each word list acted as the old or new stimuli, counterbalanced across participants.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">At study, a single word was presented on each CID trial. </button><button class="sentence">At the start of each trial, a mask (a row of hash marks ####) was presented for 500 ms to orient the participant. </button><button class="sentence">Next, a word was presented in lowercase 20-pt Courier font for 17 ms. The mask was then presented in 26-pt Courier font for 233 ms, forming a 250-ms presentation block. </button><button class="sentence">The word was then immediately presented again, but this time the exposure duration was increased by 17 ms, and the mask followed for the remainder of the 250-ms presentation block. </button><button class="sentence">Presentation continued in this way, with the total stimulus plus mask time remaining constant in each block, until the mask duration was 0 ms (15 blocks). </button><button class="sentence">When a response was made (by clicking the left mouse button), the mask was immediately presented for 2,000 ms. Participants then clicked a button that was presented below the stimulus presentation area to advance to the next trial.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">There were 70 study trials in total. </button><button class="sentence">The first and last 10 trials were considered primacy and recency filler trials, and none of the words from these trials appeared at test. </button><button class="sentence">The RTs from these filler trials were not included in any subsequent analysis. </button><button class="sentence">The remaining 50 trials contained the stimuli that would later appear at test. </button><button class="sentence">For the study phase, participants were told that a word would flash on the screen for longer and longer durations and that this would make it appear clearer over time. </button><button class="sentence">They were told that they must click the left mouse button when they knew the identity of the word and then read it aloud. </button><button class="sentence">On each trial, the time from the onset of the stimuli to the onset of the button press was recorded. </button><button class="sentence">The importance of speed was emphasized; however, errors were discouraged: Participants were told that they should click the mouse button only when they were confident that they could identify the word correctly. </button><button class="sentence">If the word had not been identified by the end of the trial, then a message appeared to the participants asking them to try to be faster on the next trial. </button><button class="sentence">RTs longer than 3,750 ms (the time that had elapsed by the end of the last stimulus presentation block) were not recorded. </button><button class="sentence">No indication of the upcoming recognition test was given.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">After the study phase, the instructions for the test phase were presented. </button><button class="sentence">We presented a single word using the CID procedure on each test trial. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were again instructed to press the mouse button when they could identify the word and then read the word aloud; they were additionally told that after identifying each word they would have to make a judgment about the word. </button><button class="sentence">After each identification, the probe “old or new?” appeared on the screen, and two buttons labeled “old” and “new” were also presented on the screen below this probe. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were instructed to click the button labeled “old” if they thought that the word they had just identified was one from the study phase. </button><button class="sentence">They were told to click the “new” button if they thought that the word had not been presented in the study phase. </button><button class="sentence">There were 100 test trials in total (50 old and 50 new trials). </button><button class="sentence">The selection of a word for each trial was randomly determined. </button><button class="sentence">Misidentification trials at study or test were excluded from all subsequent analysis. </button><button class="sentence">Responses were recorded on a tape recorder and later checked for accuracy.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">An alpha level of .05 was used for statistical tests, and <em>t</em> tests were two-tailed. </button><button class="sentence">We used the Greenhouse–Geisser correction to correct for nonsphericity on tests involving repeated measures factors with more than two levels.</button></p>
