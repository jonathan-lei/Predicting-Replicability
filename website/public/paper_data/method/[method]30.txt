1. </span><span class="sentence">The confrontational scenarios were viewed as more confrontational ( <i>M</i> = 7.75) than the others ( <i>M</i> = 2.65), <i>F</i>(1, 9) = 87.02, <i>p</i> &lt; .05.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Music</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">We selected eight exciting (e.g., “BimBamBum” by Xavier Cugat), eight neutral (e.g., “Lava” by Boozoo), and six angry (e.g., “Inquisition” by Apocalyptica) instrumental musical segments; taken together, the selections in each category were equivalent in length and familiarity to the selections in the other categories. </span><span class="sentence">A pilot test ( <i>N</i> = 10) confirmed that participants experienced greater excitement when listening to the exciting ( <i>M</i> = 4.01) segments, compared with the angry ( <i>M</i> = 1.52) and neutral ( <i>M</i> = 2.98) segments, <i>t</i>(9)s &gt; 2.89, <i>p</i>s &lt; .05, and greater anger when listening to the angry ( <i>M</i> = 3.60) segments, compared with the exciting ( <i>M</i> = 0.06) and neutral ( <i>M</i> = 0.34) segments, <i>t</i>(9)s &gt; 6.01, <i>p</i>s &lt; .05. </span><span class="sentence">Participants rated angry and exciting music as equally arousing and more arousing than neutral music ( <i>M</i>s = 5.04, 4.73, and 3.50, respectively), <i>t</i>(9)s &gt; 2.20, <i>p</i>s &lt; .05. </span><span class="sentence">Angry music ( <i>M</i> = 2.85) was rated as less pleasant than exciting ( <i>M</i> = 5.31) and neutral ( <i>M</i> = 4.98) music, <i>t</i>(9)s &gt; 5.91, <i>p</i>s &lt; .05.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Selection Tasks</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>Music-Selection Task</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">In each trial, participants read a game scenario, listened to a musical segment for 30 s, and rated the extent to which they would prefer listening to this music before playing the game (1 = <i>not at all</i>, 7 = <i>extremely</i>). </span><span class="sentence">Each scenario was paired with three angry, three exciting, and three neutral musical segments in a random order, for a total of 36 trials.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Recall-Selection Task</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">In each trial, participants read a game scenario, followed by a description of a type of event (e.g., “an event in which you were angry, involving friends”), and rated the extent to which they would prefer recalling such an event before playing the game (1 = <i>not at all</i>, 7 = <i>extremely</i>). </span><span class="sentence">As in previous research (Tamir, 2005), the event types varied by emotional tone (i.e., angry, exciting, neutral) and content (i.e., involving friends vs. strangers). </span><span class="sentence">Game scenarios and events were fully crossed and presented in a random order, resulting in a total of 24 trials.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Computer Games</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants did not play the games described in the scenarios. </span><span class="sentence">Instead, Soldier of Fortune, a first-person shooter game, served as a confrontational task. </span><span class="sentence">Diner Dash, a game in which players guide a waitress serving customers, served as a nonconfrontational task. </span><span class="sentence">A pilot test ( <i>N</i> = 10) confirmed that the games were equally interesting, engaging, and difficult, <i>t</i>(9)s &lt; 1.67, <i>p</i> &gt; .40. </span><span class="sentence">In each game of Soldier of Fortune, the number of enemies the player killed (i.e., “kills”) and the number of times the player was killed by enemies (i.e., “deaths”) were recorded. </span><span class="sentence">We then created an overall score for performance by subtracting the number of deaths from the number of kills. </span><span class="sentence">For Diner Dash, we recorded the total score, as provided by the game itself (based, in part, on the number of customers served and customers' satisfaction).</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Procedure</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">Participants were told that the experiment concerned the relation between memory and computer games and that they would either recall events from their past or perform an unrelated activity (e.g., listen to music) before playing games. </span><span class="sentence">Participants completed the music- and recall-selection tasks and were then randomly assigned to a music condition (i.e., angry, exciting, or neutral) and to a game-order condition (i.e., confrontational first and nonconfrontational second, or vice versa). </span><span class="sentence">Participants played one round of the first game for 5 min, listened to music for 3 min, and then continued listening for 5 min while playing another round. </span><span class="sentence">Next, they played the second game, following the same procedure. </span><span class="sentence">Finally, participants listened to all the musical segments they had rated earlier in the music-selection task and rated how angry, excited, pleasant, and active they felt (1 = <i>not at all</i>, 5 = <i>extremely</i>) when listening to the music.</span></p>
