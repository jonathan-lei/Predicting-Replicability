<h3>Study 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 1 was designed to examine the effect of stereotype threat on the preferred <strong data-auto="strong_text">social</strong> distance of White participants in an expected interracial contact. The principal hypothesis was that when the stereotype of racism was relevant to a potential interaction—that is, when participants expected to discuss a threatening topic—Whites would distance themselves from Black partners more than White partners. Under such conditions, it was further hypothesized that stereotype activation would positively correlate with the degree of avoidance.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Eighty-two White male undergraduates at Stanford University participated in this study in exchange for either $10 or partial course credit. Women were not included as participants in this study. Previous research has shown that threat and anxiety influence mixed-gender proximity preferences differently than same-gender proximity preferences (Ugwuegbu &amp; Anusiem, 1982). Because “Blackness” is most commonly mentally represented by “Black males” (Goff, Thomas, &amp; Jackson, in press), it was reasoned that Black males would produce the strongest effects. Therefore, only men were recruited for ostensibly same-gender dyads.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This experiment took the form of a 2 (race of partners: Black vs. White) × 2 (conversation topic: love and relationships vs. racial profiling) <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong>-subjects design. The chief dependent measures were the physical distance participants put <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> themselves and their conversation partners and the degree to which stereotypes related to their racial identity were cognitively activated by the experimental conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Word-stem completion</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We hypothesized that participants who were talking about racial profiling would sit farther away from Black partners the more threatened they felt. To measure threat (and rule out the possibility that general White identity or anxiety was driving the effect), we measured the activation of three distinct concepts: White racial identity, negative stereotypes about Whites as racist, and general <strong data-auto="strong_text">social</strong> anxiety. To measure the activation of these concepts, we used a word-stem completion task similar to that employed in previous stereotype threat research (e.g., Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995). Ten words were chosen for each category—White racial identity, negative stereotypes that Whites are racist, and <strong data-auto="strong_text">social</strong> anxiety—from pretests involving 157 Stanford undergraduates. In our pretest, 127 participants simply listed words associated with one of the categories. The 25 most common words for each category were then selected and given to 30 participants. These 30 participants rated each word for how strongly related it was to its category. The 10 highest rated words in each category were then selected as target words. All words are listed in the Appendix. These target words were randomly intermixed with 60 filler words that could not be completed as words that would fit any of the three category concepts, creating a sheet of 90 total word stems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For the purpose of analysis, the number of target words a participant completed in each category was recorded. Of those words, the number of target words the participant filled out in a category-relevant manner (e.g., <em>RACIST</em> as opposed to <em>RACKET</em>) was counted. Last, the number of target words filled out in a category-relevant manner was divided by the total number of target words the participant had completed. This ratio, then, is the measure of concept activation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Faces</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To convey the race of the participants' prospective partners, we showed participants Polaroid pictures of their ostensible partners. Pictures of Black and White men were selected from a data set of 20 Polaroids, each of which was rated on stereotypicality and attractiveness. Two Black faces and two White faces were selected such that the Black faces were neither reliably more attractive (<em>M</em> = 3.50) than the White faces (<em>M</em> = 3.46) nor reliably more stereotypically Black (<em>M</em> = 4.57) than the White faces were stereotypically White (<em>M</em> = 4.50).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Distancing measurement</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The principal hypothesis was that participants would sit farther away from Black partners than White partners when participants felt under threat of confirming the negative group stereotype. In order to measure this, we asked participants to arrange three chairs—one for themselves and two for their two prospective partners—so that the three of them could have a “comfortable conversation.” Participants under the stereotype threat of possibly being seen as racist might put more distance <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> their own chair and the chairs of their two partners when they anticipate their partners are Black as a means of distancing themselves from the interaction. However, another factor could also affect the distance measure: a dispositional preference for some level of distance <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> all three individuals involved.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If participants positioned themselves far away from their partners, then the configuration of chairs would look like there was an odd person out (the isosceles triangle pictured in Configuration 1.1 in Figure 1). However, participants who were dispositionally more comfortable with larger interpersonal distances might also create distance <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> themselves and their partners. This configuration would look quite different from one created by anxiety specific to the partners and the situation and would look more like the equilateral triangle pictured in Configuration 1.2 in Figure 1. Therefore, to capture the first of these patterns—without the second—we developed a distance index in which the average distance <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> the participant and his prospective conversation partners (AB distance in Figure 1) was analyzed, covarying for the total distance the participant put <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> all three chairs (ABC distance in Figure 1). This calculation allows one to capture a participant's motivation to reduce possible tension, controlling for his individual proximity preferences. That is, by covarying for the total distance <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> the three chairs, we were able to measure the relative “odd-person-out” effect. Individuals who sat close to one partner and far from the other would score similarly to someone who sat equidistant from both partners. Likewise, individuals who sat equally close to both partners but sat the partners far away from each other would score lower than individuals who sat themselves and their partners equidistant from each other. This odd-person-out index gives an estimate of the degree to which the participant's chair placement reflected specifically a desire to distance himself from the potential interaction partners.<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/b1df587099af90e6781e0cbb886e4e34/5ebcb994/pdh/psp/psp-94-1-91-fig1a.gif" alt="psp-94-1-91-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1. Imagine that average distance between the participant and the partners is equal in Configuration 1.1 and Configuration 1.2. Only Configuration 1.1 indicates that the participant is distancing from the partners."/><em>Figure 1. Imagine that average distance <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> the participant and the partners is equal in Configuration 1.1 and Configuration 1.2. Only Configuration 1.1 indicates that the participant is distancing from the partners.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It was hypothesized that participants expecting to talk with Black partners about racial profiling would place their own chairs farther away from the chairs of their partners than would participants in any of the other conditions. To further ensure that participants were sitting farther away from their partners rather than in some other configuration (see Figure 1), we computed another index in which Distance C was subtracted from the average of Distances A and B. If participants were distancing themselves from their partners, then [(A + B)/2] – C would be positive. If participants were sitting in some other configuration, then this index would be 0 or negative.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In fact, participants who expected to speak with two Black partners about racial profiling scored positively on this index (<em>M</em> = 1.74), whereas those who anticipated speaking to Black partners about love and relationships (<em>M</em> = –1.59) and those who anticipated speaking to White partners about either topic (racial profiling, <em>M</em> = –0.55; love and relationships, <em>M</em> = –0.43) scored negatively. This suggests that participants sat farther away from their partners in the Black/racial-profiling condition and not in any other condition. As the distance scores presented in Figure 2 show, this is precisely what was observed.<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/bcd2772e9612938be2f09b9fff505d22/5ebcb994/pdh/psp/psp-94-1-91-fig2a.gif" alt="psp-94-1-91-fig2a.gif" title="Figure 2.

The experimenter, who was kept blind to condition, then checked the participant's name off a list of three names. After administering the consent and demographic forms, the experimenter took the participant's picture with a Polaroid instant camera and placed it <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> two other pictures, ostensibly of the two partners with whom the participant would later have a conversation (no conversation would actually take place). In the Black partner condition, both pictures were of Black males. In the White partner condition, both pictures were of White males.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Cover story</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Pretesting revealed that expecting to talk to two Black males—probably in light of their limited numbers in the student body—tended to arouse suspicion in our participants, especially when they learned that the topic of conversation was racially charged. To combat this suspicion, we told participants that they were participating in an experiment on “diverse conversations” in which the gender and racial makeup of the groups were manipulated to create diversity. Unfortunately, pretesting also revealed that White participants reported being threatened at the mere mention of diverse conversations. In light of this finding, it was expected that stereotype activation would not differ by condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Topic selection</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants then chose a topic slip, without looking, from a grab bag. In reality, all slips in the bag stated that the conversation topic would be either <em>racial profiling</em> in the racial profiling condition or <em>love and relationships</em> in the love and relationships condition. Participants were then told that they would be discussing the topic they had picked from the bag.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Distance measurement</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After the topic was selected, participants were given a “cognitive engagement task”—in actuality, the word-stem completion task—ostensibly to ensure that they were taking the conversation and experiment seriously. Participants were asked to complete the task as quickly as possible by finishing each word stem with the first word that came to mind. After 6 min, the word-stem completion sheet was collected, and participants were escorted to the room where the conversation would purportedly take place. Upon arriving, the experimenter feigned frustration at the fact that the three chairs were lined up in the corner of an otherwise featureless room. The experimenter apologized for the inconvenience and then asked participants to set up the chairs “so that the three of [them could] have a comfortable conversation” and instructed them to “take a seat” in one of the chairs after they had arranged them. The experimenter then left the room, ostensibly to retrieve the other two partners for the conversation. After 1 min, the experimenter returned to the room, probed the participants for suspicions, thoroughly debriefed them, and thanked them for their participation.</p>
