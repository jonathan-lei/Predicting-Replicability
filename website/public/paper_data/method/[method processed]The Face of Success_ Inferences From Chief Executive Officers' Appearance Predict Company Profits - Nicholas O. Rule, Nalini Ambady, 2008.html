<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">METHOD</h2></div><div class="head-b"><h3>Stimuli</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">We selected the 25 highest and 25 lowest ranked companies from the 2006 listing on the Fortune 500 Web site (http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500). </span><span class="sentence">The information on this Web site included the companies' Web addresses, which we used to obtain a photograph of each company's CEO.<sup>1</sup> Each image was cropped tightly around the CEO's head to remove all extrafacial information, was converted to gray scale, and was standardized in size. </span><span class="sentence">From the Fortune Web site, we also obtained information about each company's financial performance (revenues and profits) for fiscal year (FY) 2005, the year on which the 2006 Fortune listing was based, as well as for the previous and following years (FY 2004 and FY 2006). </span><span class="sentence">In cases in which Fortune did not list the information, revenues and profits were obtained from Google Finance (http://finance.google.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu) or the companies' annual reports. </span><span class="sentence">Two companies were acquired by other companies during FY 2006 and were excluded from the analysis. </span><span class="sentence">Revenues and profits from FY 2004 through FY 2006 showed high consistency, mean <i>r</i><sub>revenues</sub>(45) = .99 and mean <i>r</i><sub>profits</sub>(45) = .93.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Procedure</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">One hundred undergraduates (ages 18–22; 65 female, 35 male) received credit in an introductory psychology class for making either trait ratings (<i>n</i> = 50) or global assessments of leadership ability (i.e., “How good would this person be at leading a company.” </span><span class="sentence"><i>n</i> = 50), using 7-point scales. </span><span class="sentence">In the trait condition, five personality traits—competence, dominance, likeability, facial maturity, and trustworthiness—were rated in separate, randomly ordered blocks. </span><span class="sentence">Within each block, the faces were presented in random order using Medialab. </span><span class="sentence">Three participants recognized CEOs, and their data were removed.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Control Variables</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">As attractiveness affects judgments of appearance (Langlois et al., 2000), we asked another group of participants (<i>n</i> = 34; 18 female, 16 male) to use a 7-point scale to rate the faces on attractiveness. </span><span class="sentence">Also, four naive research assistants coded each photo for affect, again using a 7-point scale (interrater reliability, measured by the Spearman-Brown <i>r</i>, was .903). </span><span class="sentence">Finally, to control for differences in age that might affect perceptions of the CEOs' appearance, we obtained each CEO's age from Google Finance (http://finance.google.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu).</span></p>
