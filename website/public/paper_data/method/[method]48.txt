<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> hypothesis presented here holds that participants implicitly learn contingencies and implicitly use them to aid responding. Further, we proposed a mechanism whereby participants use <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> information to reduce the response threshold for the predicted response. This account predicts facilitation with no corresponding interference when response latency is the dependent variable but both facilitation and interference when errors are the dependent variable. Both of these predictions were borne out. Further, <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> effects operate separately from the <strong data-auto="strong_text">Stroop</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong>, a finding supported by the null interaction between <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">Stroop</strong> trial type. To further test the <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> hypothesis, in Experiments 1 and 2 we investigate <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> effects in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> paradigm developed by Schmidt et al. (2007) using color-unrelated words.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It could be argued that the size of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">Stroop</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> is only incidentally equivalent in the high, medium, and low <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> conditions. It could also be claimed that the failure to find increased interference in the high <strong data-auto="strong_text">proportion</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">congruent</strong> condition and decreased facilitation in the low <strong data-auto="strong_text">proportion</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">congruent</strong> condition is merely a Type II error. But the modulation hypothesis rests on the critical assumption that the reason for variations in the size of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">Stroop</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> is that participants detect the <strong data-auto="strong_text">proportion</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">congruent</strong> items. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> hypothesis, on the other hand, makes no such claim. According to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> hypothesis, words and responses merely have to be correlated; color-related words are not necessary to observe <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In that vein, Schmidt et al. (2007; see also Musen &amp; Squire, 1993) have reported several experiments that provide further support for the <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> hypothesis interpretation of the ISPC <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> by showing that <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> effects can be observed in the absence of a <strong data-auto="strong_text">Stroop</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong>. In their experiments, color-unrelated words (e.g., <em>MOVE</em>) were presented most often in a given color (e.g., <em>MOVE</em> 75% of the time in blue, <em>SENT</em> 75% of the time in green, etc.). Key press responses were faster to high <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> trials (e.g., <em>MOVE</em>blue) than low <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> trials (e.g., <em>MOVE</em>green). Thus, the results of these experiments confirm that participants are able to use words (even when they are color-unrelated) to predict what response to make. This is a critical result, because the modulation hypothesis cannot accommodate these findings given that the words and colors have no <strong data-auto="strong_text">congruency</strong> relation that can be used to decide whether or not to attend to the word.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiments 1 and 2 use the Schmidt et al. (2007) paradigm to demonstrate <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> effects in the absence of any <strong data-auto="strong_text">congruency</strong> relations. These experiments include a medium <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> condition (not used by Schmidt et al.) to demonstrate a facilitation-only pattern in the response latencies (Experiment 1) and facilitation and interference in errors (Experiment 2) to mirror the main effects observed in our reanalyses of Jacoby et al. (2003).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 1 was a two-choice, rather than a four-choice, task (in part to ensure that the interactions observed by Logan et al., 1984, were not attributable to something more than sequential confounds). In Experiment 1, several color-unrelated words were presented most often in a randomly assigned color. For instance, <em>SEVEN</em> might be presented 75% percent of the time in blue and 25% of the time in green. Other words, for instance <em>CHAIR</em>, were presented in blue and green equally often. This type of manipulation creates high <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> (.75; e.g., <em>SEVEN</em>blue), medium <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> (.50; e.g., <em>CHAIR</em>blue), and low <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> (.25; e.g., <em>SEVEN</em>green) trials. Experiment 1 focuses primarily on response latencies, with the goal of replicating the facilitation-only pattern of results observed in Reanalysis 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 2 uses the response deadline procedure used by Jacoby et al. (2003), in which participants are given a very short amount of time to respond so as to maximize errors, and thus the analysis focuses on the error data. Experiment 2 attempts to replicate the findings observed in Reanalysis 2 and tests new predictions from the response threshold model. In both experiments, the responses are manual (i.e., key press) rather than verbal.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thirty-four University of Waterloo undergraduates participated in Experiment 1 in exchange for course credit.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All stimuli were presented on a standard computer monitor and responses were made on a QWERTY keyboard. Participants pressed the <em>F</em> key for “blue” and the <em>J</em> key for “green.” Stimulus presentation and response timing were controlled by E-Prime software (<strong data-auto="strong_text">Psychology</strong> Software Tools, 2002).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There were three display words (<em>SEVEN, GLIDE, CHAIR</em>) and two display colors (blue, green) in the experiment. The words were selected to be of the same length. For each participant, one of the words (e.g., <em>SEVEN</em>) was presented most often (three out of four times per block) in blue, another word (e.g., <em>GLIDE</em>) was presented most often (three out of four times per block) in green, and the final word (e.g., <em>CHAIR</em>) was presented equally often (twice each per block) in blue and green. Assignment of words to colors was counterbalanced across participants. Words were presented in bold 18-point Courier New font. The RGB values for the stimulus colors were 0,0,255 (blue) and 0,255,0 (green). There were three <strong data-auto="strong_text">contingency</strong> levels in the experiment: high (.75; e.g., <em>SEVEN</em>blue), medium (.50; e.g., <em>CHAIR</em>blue), and low (.25; <em>GLIDE</em>blue).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There were 420 trials in this experiment, consisting of 35 blocks of 12 trials each. On each trial, a white (255,255,255) fixation cross (i.e., “+”) was presented in the middle of a black screen for 250 ms. This was followed by 250 ms of blank screen, followed by the stimulus display. The stimulus display was presented until a response was made or until the trial timed out at 2,000 ms. Correct responses were followed by a blank screen for 250 ms before the next fixation cross. Incorrect and null responses were followed by the messages <em>Incorrect</em> and <em>Too Slow</em>, respectively, for 1,000 ms in red (255,0,0).</p>
