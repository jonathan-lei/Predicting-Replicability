<h3>Experiment 2: Global Versus Local Processing, Moderate Standards, and Subjective Versus Objective Scales</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this experiment, we induced <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">versus</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> by making participants attend to either large or small letters, respectively. In an allegedly unrelated task, they were asked to compare their own alcohol consumption with one of two celebrities who constituted either a moderately high standard (the British pop singer Robbie Williams) or a moderately low comparison standard (the former tennis star Steffi Graf). Without prior activation of <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">styles</strong>, we expected participants to assimilate self-evaluations toward the moderate standards on the objective scale and <strong data-auto="strong_text">contrast</strong> away from the standards on the subjective scale, as found by Mussweiler and Strack (2000). We expected <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> to tilt the balance toward <strong data-auto="strong_text">assimilation</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> to tilt the balance toward <strong data-auto="strong_text">contrast</strong>. We also wanted to examine whether <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">versus</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> would override the <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> of subjective <strong data-auto="strong_text">versus</strong> objective scales, so that after <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> there would be a <strong data-auto="strong_text">contrast</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> on both scales, whereas after <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> there would be an <strong data-auto="strong_text">assimilation</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> on both scales.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Mussweiler and Strack's (2000) SAM explains the <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> of scale type by suggesting that with objective scales, accessible knowledge affects <strong data-auto="strong_text">judgment</strong>, whereas subjective scales are used as a reference point to anchor the <strong data-auto="strong_text">judgment</strong> of comparison. Biernat and Manis's (2007) model on stereotypes also predicts <strong data-auto="strong_text">assimilation</strong> on objective scales and <strong data-auto="strong_text">contrast</strong> on subjective scales. According to the authors, this occurs because objective scales evoke comparison to the entire population, and information about the group is used to interpret the target (e.g., “She is a woman; therefore, she probably has high verbal skills”). Contrary to that, subjective scales evoke more <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> comparisons within the group (e.g., “For a woman, her verbal skills are not that high”).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As mentioned before, we hypothesized, in line with IEM, that subjective scales would enhance <strong data-auto="strong_text">contrast</strong> because the target and the standard are used to define the range of the scale on which they obviously occupy opposite ends. We believed, however, that if one took enough of a <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> perspective, then a value range wider than that defined by the target and the standard might be considered, thus allowing for inclusion and <strong data-auto="strong_text">assimilation</strong>. We also thought that it might be possible that a <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> perspective would narrow the range of values around the target and the standard, and would thus produce exclusion and <strong data-auto="strong_text">contrast</strong>, even with objective scales. Thus, we thought that both types of scales might produce both <strong data-auto="strong_text">assimilation</strong>, if processed globally, and <strong data-auto="strong_text">contrast</strong>, if processed locally. The next study examined these predictions.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 124 undergraduate students (62 women, 62 men) at the University of Bremen majoring in disciplines other than <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> who were recruited for an experimental session described as consisting of diverse psychological tests. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions, tested in groups of up to 3 in sessions lasting approximately 2 hr, and paid 16 euros for participation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We conducted a pretest to examine common attitudes about drug consumption among a number of rock, pop, and hip hop singers, and selected the British pop singer Robbie Williams, a well known celebrity in Germany, as our moderately high standard of drug consumption. <sup/> We conducted yet another pretest in which a different group of 20 participants estimated how often they and a number of celebrities engaged in a variety of behaviors. The critical questions pertained to the number of times the targets consumed drugs and alcohol within 1 month. On average, participants reported consuming drugs and alcohol about 10 times a month. Participants estimated that Robbie Williams (the high standard) consumes drugs and alcohol about 20 times a month, whereas Steffi Graf (the low standard) consumes drugs and alcohol about once to twice a month.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There were three questions about drug and alcohol consumption, gauging comparative, objective, and subjective estimates. One third of the participants were first asked whether they consumed drugs, including alcohol, more or less often than Robbie Williams (i.e., the high standard). The other third were asked whether they consumed drugs and alcohol more or less often than Steffi Graf (i.e., the low standard). One third of the participants did not answer a comparative question. In the subsequent objective <strong data-auto="strong_text">judgment</strong>, all the participants were asked to estimate the number of times they consumed drugs and alcohol per month. Finally, using a rating scale that ranged from 1 (<em>not at all extensive</em>) to 9 (<em>very extensive</em>), all the participants indicated how extensive their drug and alcohol consumption was.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Upon arrival of the participants, the experimenter handed out the materials of the two studies and pointed out that they were unrelated to each other and were administered together for efficiency reasons. Participants first completed the <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong>–<strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> task (Navon, 1977), which was administered on a computer and which presented a series of <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> letters (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) that were formed with <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> letters (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm; i.e., each horizontal or vertical line making up a <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> letter was formed with five closely spaced <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> letters). On each trial, participants were first presented with a fixation cross (+) in the center of the screen for 500 ms. Then, one of eight <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> composite letters was randomly presented, and participants were instructed to press a blue response key if the stimulus contained the letter <em>L</em> and to press a red response key if the stimulus contained the letter <em>H</em>. They were asked to respond as quickly as possible. The task was set up so that by random assignment, one third of the participants always had to detect a <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> letter (<strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> condition), one third of the participants always had to detect a <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> letter (<strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> condition), and one third of the participants had to detect <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> letters equally often (control <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> condition). More specifically, in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> condition, each set of composite letters included eight <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> targets (an <em>H</em> made of <em>F</em>s, an <em>H</em> made of <em>T</em>s, an <em>L</em> made of <em>T</em>s, and an <em>L</em> made of <em>F</em>s) and no <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> targets, whereas in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> condition, each set included eight <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> targets (an <em>F</em> made of <em>H</em>s, an <em>F</em> made of <em>L</em>s, a <em>T</em> made of <em>H</em>s, and a <em>T</em> made of <em>L</em>s) and no <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> targets. In the control <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> condition, four of the composite letters included <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> targets (an <em>H</em> made of <em>F</em>s, an <em>H</em> made of <em>T</em>s, an <em>L</em> made of <em>T</em>s, and an <em>L</em> made of <em>F</em>s) and four <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> targets (an <em>F</em> made of <em>H</em>s, an <em>F</em> made of <em>L</em>s, a <em>T</em> made of <em>H</em>s, and a <em>T</em> made of <em>L</em>s). Participants worked on a total of eight sets of composite letters: 48 <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong>, 48 <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong>, or 24 <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> trials each.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants then received a folder with instructions on the <strong data-auto="strong_text">social</strong> comparison task, modeled after the task used by Mussweiler (2001) and Mussweiler and Strack (2000). Participants were first informed that the purpose of this study was to pretest materials for future studies on self-evaluation. They were told that in order to obtain normative data for these studies, the experimenter would ask them a number of questions about drug consumption. Participants were told that before evaluating themselves, they would compare themselves to a celebrity: They were asked to bring this person to mind and to compare themselves with this person with respect to drug and alcohol consumption. Participants were encouraged to take some time to make this comparison. To ensure that participants did indeed engage in the respective comparisons, the experimenter asked them to indicate how difficult it was for them to make the comparison, using a scale ranging from 1 (<em>very easy</em>) to 9 (<em>very difficult</em>). There were no differences in experienced difficulty across conditions. Then, participants answered the two critical questions, one subjective and one objective question assessing self-evaluations of drug and alcohol consumption. The order of the two questions was counterbalanced and had no effects. This procedure was similar to that of Mussweiler and Strack (2000). After completion of the two tasks, participants were asked to perform other unrelated tasks, fully debriefed after the entire session, paid, and thanked for their participation. In sum, Experiment 2 was based on a 3 (<strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong>: <strong data-auto="strong_text">global</strong> vs. <strong data-auto="strong_text">local</strong> vs. control) × 2 (standard: high vs. low) × 2 (scale: subjective vs. objective) factorial design, with only the last factor manipulated within participants.</p>
