<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">GENERAL METHOD</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">For all the experiments reported here, we presented both preschool children and adults with 3 × 3 matrices of color photographs of threat-relevant and threat-irrelevant stimuli. </span><span class="sentence">The participants were asked to find the one threat-relevant target (snake) among eight threat-irrelevant distractors or the one threat-irrelevant target among eight threat-relevant distractors. </span><span class="sentence">Two changes to the standard visual search task were instituted to make the procedure appropriate for young children. </span><span class="sentence">First, so that we could obtain reliable reaction time data from 3- to 5-year-olds, we presented the stimuli on a touch-screen monitor, asking each participant to touch the target on the screen as quickly as possible (see <span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-figure1-j1467-9280200802081x">Fig. 1</span>). </span><span class="sentence">Second, only target-present matrices were presented, because the touch-screen procedure precluded the inclusion of no-target matrices. </span><span class="sentence">We assumed that the latency to touch a target would be affected by any differential responsiveness to evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli versus nonthreat stimuli.</span></p><div class="figure" id="figure1-j.1467-9280.2008.02081.x"><div class="holder"><img alt="&#10;

all but 5 parents were female. </span><span class="sentence">The children and parents were recruited from records of birth announcements in the local community and were predominantly Caucasian and middle-class. </span><span class="sentence">Each child was randomly assigned to one of two target conditions and one of two stimulus orders. </span><span class="sentence">For convenience, each parent was assigned to the same condition as his or her child.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Prior to testing, the parents were asked whether the children had ever seen a live snake and whether the children were afraid of snakes. </span><span class="sentence">Parents also indicated whether they themselves were afraid of snakes.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Materials</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">For each experiment, we selected 24 photographs for each stimulus category. </span><span class="sentence">On a given trial, 9 of these photographs were displayed in a 3 × 3 matrix. </span><span class="sentence">Each matrix contained 1 target picture from one category and 8 distractor pictures from another category. </span><span class="sentence">Across the experiments, the stimulus categories were snakes, flowers, frogs, and caterpillars. </span><span class="sentence">All the depicted animals and flowers were brightly colored. </span><span class="sentence">The snakes were all depicted coiled on the ground or in trees (to maximize the size of the snake images). </span><span class="sentence">None of the snakes or other animals were depicted in a threatening pose. </span><span class="sentence">The photographs were scanned from nature books and adjusted to an image size of 325 × 245 pixels. </span><span class="sentence">A coder blind to the purpose of the research rated the brightness of all pictures on a scale from 1 ( <i>very bright</i>) to 5 ( <i>very dull</i>). </span><span class="sentence">The average ratings for the snakes, flowers, frogs, and caterpillars were 2.7, 2.7, 2.8, and 2.5, respectively.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">A MultiSync LCD 2010X color touch-screen monitor was used to present each picture matrix on a 61-cm (24-in.) screen. </span><span class="sentence">The overall matrix size was 39.4 cm × 39.4 cm, with 1.27 cm between rows and 0.64 cm between columns. </span><span class="sentence">The individual pictures measured 11.47 × 8.64 cm. </span><span class="sentence">Each of the 24 pictures in the target category served as the target once, appearing in each of the nine positions in the matrix two or three times. </span><span class="sentence">Each of the 24 pictures in the distractor category appeared multiple times; the different distractors were presented approximately the same number of times across trials. </span><span class="sentence">One stimulus order was created by randomly arranging the matrices, and the second order was the reverse of the first. </span><span class="sentence">An outline of a child's handprints was located on the table immediately in front of the monitor.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Procedure</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">The child was seated in front of the touch-screen monitor (approximately 40 cm from the base of the screen) and told to place his or her hands on the handprints. </span><span class="sentence">This ensured that the child's hands were in the same place at the start of each trial, making it possible to collect reliable latency data. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter stood alongside to monitor and instruct the child throughout the procedure.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">First, a set of seven practice trials was given to teach the child how to use the touch screen. </span><span class="sentence">On the first two trials, a single picture appeared on the screen, and the child was asked to touch it. </span><span class="sentence">The first picture was from the target category, and the second from the distractor category. </span><span class="sentence">(All pictures used in the practice trials were chosen randomly from the original sets of 24.) </span><span class="sentence">On the next two trials, the display consisted of 1 target and 1 distractor picture, and the child was asked to touch only the target picture. </span><span class="sentence">On each of the final three practice trials, a different 9-picture matrix was displayed. </span><span class="sentence">The child was told that the task was to find the “ <i>X</i>” (target) among “ <i>Y</i>s” (distractors) as quickly as possible, touch it on the screen, and then return his or her hands to the handprints. </span><span class="sentence">All the children readily learned the procedure.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">A series of 24 test trials followed. </span><span class="sentence">A different picture matrix containing one target and eight distractors was presented on each trial. </span><span class="sentence">Between trials, a large smiley face appeared on the screen. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter pressed the face when she judged that the child was looking at it, causing the next matrix to appear. </span><span class="sentence">In this way, we ensured that the child's full attention was on the screen before each matrix appeared. </span><span class="sentence">Latency was automatically recorded from the onset of the matrix to when the child touched one of the pictures on the screen.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">After the child had completed all 24 trials, his or her parent was tested in exactly the same manner. </span><span class="sentence">The parent had not been told about the experimental hypothesis and had not been present while the child was tested.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Analyses</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">In each experiment, latency to touch the target was analyzed in a 2 (target stimulus: snake vs. comparison) × 2 (age: children vs. adults) × 2 (child's snake experience: child reported as having some experience with snakes vs. child reported as having no experience with snakes) analysis of variance (ANOVA). </span><span class="sentence">All factors were between subjects. </span><span class="sentence">Preliminary analyses revealed no effects of experimenter, gender, order of stimuli, trial, or parents' or children's snake fear (those reported to fear snakes vs. those reported to have no fear) in any of the experiments, so these variables were not included in the analyses. </span><span class="sentence">Following standard procedures for visual search tasks, we included only trials in which the correct target was selected. </span><span class="sentence">Participants rarely erred (fewer than 2% of the trials in Experiment 1 and fewer than 5% in Experiments 2 and 3), and errors did not vary by target.</span></p>
