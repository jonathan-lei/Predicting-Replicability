<h3>Experiment 1: Depth of Processing</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In Experiment 1, we manipulated strength by varying the depth of processing; that is, <em>strong</em> words were encoded with an orienting task involving a pleasantness judgment, whereas <em>weak</em> words were encoded with an orienting task that involved determining whether the word contained letter <em>E</em>.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Sixty-four University of North Carolina, Greensboro, undergraduates participated for course credit and reported not expecting a memory test in their final verbal reports. </span><span class="sentence">They were randomly assigned to the forget or control group.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Two lists of 16 medium-frequency nouns were created. </span><span class="sentence">Half of the List 1 words contained the letter <em>E</em> and half did not. </span><span class="sentence">List 1 was split into two blocks of 8 items that were encoded with the same orienting task (either pleasantness judgment or letter <em>E</em>). </span><span class="sentence">Blocked presentation was employed to avoid frequent task switching and floor recall of List 1 weak items. </span><span class="sentence">The presentation order of the strong versus weak blocks was counterbalanced. </span><span class="sentence">Also, each word was assigned to the pleasantness task or the letter <em>E</em> task equally often. </span><span class="sentence">On List 2, half of the words rhymed with the word <em>seven</em> and half did not. </span><span class="sentence">All List 2 items were encoded with the same orienting task involving rhyming.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were informed that the purpose of the study was to design word norms for materials for a later experiment (cover stories are available on request). </span><span class="sentence">They were told that if a smiley-face icon appeared under a word, they were to indicate if it was pleasant or not (strong items), and if the letter <em>E</em> appeared under a word, they were to indicate if the word contained an <em>E</em> (weak items). </span><span class="sentence">Items were presented once at a rate of 4 s per word.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After the first list, half of the participants were told that they would need to rate one more list (further termed the <em>control group</em>). </span><span class="sentence">The remaining participants were told to forget the first list before moving on to rate the second list (further termed the <em>forget group</em>). </span><span class="sentence">They were told,</span></p><blockquote><span class="sentence">The list of words you just rated was the first list that we need to collect ratings for. </span><span class="sentence">Could you please rate one more list of words? </span><span class="sentence">However, it is really important that you not be influenced by your prior ratings. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, please make an effort to try and forget those words and pretend you did not rate anything. </span><span class="sentence">Try not to think of the earlier words in order not to contaminate the judgments on these new items.</span></blockquote><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Then the second list of 16 items was presented. </span><span class="sentence">List 2 words were judged for whether or not they rhymed with the word <em>seven</em>. </span><span class="sentence">The choice of the rhyming task was based on pilot testing because when both lists were processed with the same orienting task, the recall of the List 1 weak items was at floor. </span><span class="sentence">A surprise written free recall test was given afterwards on List 1, followed by List 2. </span><span class="sentence">Recall was carried out on separate sheets of paper for each list, with 90 s allotted for the recall of each list. </span><span class="sentence">After the memory test, participants were asked whether they suspected that their memory would be tested.</span></p>
