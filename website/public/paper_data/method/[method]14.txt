<h4>Study 3</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One form of opinion expression (especially in political domains) is the display of bumper stickers on one's vehicle. The aftermath of the 2004 U.S. presidential election provided an appropriate context in which to examine this form of opinion expression among descriptive and prescriptive deviants. In Study 3, we accomplished this by recording the proportions of pro-Democratic and pro-Republican bumper stickers in two different counties of California: a “Blue” county (i.e., one with more registered Democrats than Republicans) and a “Red” county (i.e., one with more registered Republicans than Democrats).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We argue that the distinction <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> Democratic and Republican bumper sticker holders is not simply that <strong data-auto="strong_text">between</strong> individuals who espouse the majority and minority positions in each location. A bumper sticker supporting a particular political candidate or party identifies one not just as a member of a minority or majority group but as an especially committed member of that group. Thus, we argue—indeed, we demonstrate in survey results reported—that displaying a sticker on one's vehicle in support of a candidate is a sufficiently distinctive act that it qualifies one as a statistical deviant, irrespective of majority/minority status. For purposes of this study, Democratic sticker holders were classified as descriptive deviants in the Blue county and prescriptive deviants in the Red county. Conversely, Republican sticker holders were categorized as descriptive deviants in the Red county and prescriptive deviants in the Blue county.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We hypothesized that, irrespective of the prescriptive county norm, descriptive deviant stickers would be overrepresented and prescriptive deviant stickers underrepresented in each county. More precisely, we expected that the ratio of descriptive deviant stickers to prescriptive deviant stickers in each county would be significantly higher than the ratio of descriptive deviant voters to prescriptive deviant voters.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The study was conducted at six different Target store locations—three in Santa Clara County (the Blue county) and three in San Diego County (the Red county)—over a 2-week period in March 2005. There were 8 days of data collection in total. To minimize the chances that the same sticker would be counted more than once (e.g., on different days or at different times), we assigned one researcher to each parking lot. On the days of the study, the researchers spent approximately 45 min circulating around the parking lots of each store and tallying the numbers of political bumper stickers that were displayed. Pro-Kerry and anti-Bush stickers were both considered to indicate Democratic voters, whereas pro-Bush stickers were classified as indicating Republican voters. <sup/> There were no anti-Kerry stickers in either county.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To measure additional variables of potential interest, the researchers put an addressed and stamped envelope containing a short survey on all sticker-sporting vehicles. Of the 53 individuals with bumper stickers on their vehicles, 30 (57%) returned the survey. Respondents were asked to indicate how they themselves felt about George W. Bush and John Kerry, as well as how they thought the average resident of their county felt about the two candidates. Responses to these questions were made on a 10-point scale (1 = <em>don't like him at all</em>, 10 = <em>like him very much</em>). The order in which the questions about Bush and Kerry were presented was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although participants were not asked to specify their county of residence, the survey items were worded to pertain to either San Diego County or Santa Clara County (e.g., “How would you describe the average San Diego [Santa Clara] County resident's feelings toward George W. Bush [John Kerry]?”). Thus, we can be reasonably assured that participants who provided answers to these questions were from the county in which the study was conducted. Only 1 participant—a Republican sticker holder in San Diego County— indicated that he or she was not a resident of that county and thus did not complete the survey. The data from that participant were omitted from all subsequent analyses.</p>
