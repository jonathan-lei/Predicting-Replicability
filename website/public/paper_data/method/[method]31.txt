<h3>Studies 1A and 1B</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The crucial mediator in our hypothesized path from values to resistance is amount of message processing. </button><button class="sentence">Message recipients might think more carefully about the content of a message if they expect that information to relate to values they hold as relatively important rather than unimportant (cf. Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1990). </button><button class="sentence">Our first two experiments addressed whether consideration of a message in relation to important rather than unimportant values influences the level of message processing. </button><button class="sentence">We expected that consideration of important values would lead to greater processing (elaboration) than consideration of unimportant values. </button><button class="sentence">To address this question, we adapted the paradigm used by Ostrom and Brock (1969; see also Murray et al., 1996) in which participants are randomly assigned to consider normatively important or unimportant values in relation to a persuasive message about a topic of low personal relevance to the message recipients. </button><button class="sentence">To index the level of processing of the persuasive message, we created two versions of the persuasive message, one that contained relatively strong (compelling) arguments and one that contained relatively weak (specious) arguments. </button><button class="sentence">When processing is high rather than low, there should be larger effects of argument quality on attitudes and on the favorability of thoughts toward the attitude object (see Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986).</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">One hundred forty-four introductory psychology students participated in Study 1A, and 79 participated in Study 1B. </button><button class="sentence">Students were randomly assigned to conditions of a 2 (value: important vs. unimportant) × 2 (argument quality: strong vs. weak) between-participants design.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were asked to relate values to a message, reported attitudes on the topic, and listed the thoughts that came to mind while reading the message. </button><button class="sentence">First, participants received a booklet presenting a written message containing either strong or weak arguments arguing that a fictitious country, Tashkentistan, should be allowed to join the European Union (EU). </button><button class="sentence">After viewing the message for the first time, participants were asked to engage in a “speech interpretation task.” </button><button class="sentence">Participants read three 3- to 4-sentence excerpts (paragraphs) from the message, each listed separately on a page along with an “idea” (i.e., a value). </button><button class="sentence">The value had been identified in pretests as normatively important or unimportant. </button><button class="sentence">Each message paragraph was created such that some elements were related to both the important and the unimportant values that were associated (in different conditions) with the excerpt. </button><button class="sentence">For each excerpt, participants were asked to circle the value and to circle a keyword in the excerpt that was most related to the value, connecting the two circled words by drawing a line between them. </button><button class="sentence"> After the speech interpretation task, participants were asked to report their attitudes toward Tashkentistan entering the EU and to list the thoughts that came to mind when reading the message.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Two differences existed between Studies 1A and 1B. </button><button class="sentence">Participants in Study 1A (but not Study 1B) were asked to rate how appropriate the idea (value) was to the excerpt after drawing a link between each idea and a word in the excerpt (following Ostrom &amp; Brock, 1969). </button><button class="sentence">This rating ensured that both important and unimportant values were perceived as having equal fit to their associated paragraphs. </button><button class="sentence">Also, after reporting their attitudes but before the thought listing, Study 1B participants were asked to report how closely their attitudes were related to their core, self-defining values (using items from a past measure of value-relevance of attitudes; Boninger et al., 1995; Holbrook et al., 2005).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Independent Variables</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Value importance</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">In a pretest, three values (adopted from Schwartz, 1992) were identified as normatively important (i.e., self-respect, <em>M</em> = 8.11; loyalty, <em>M</em> = 8.15; and freedom, <em>M</em> = 8.44, on a 9-point scale with 1 = <em>not at all important</em> and 9 = <em>very important</em>). </button><button class="sentence">Three other values were identified as normatively less important (i.e., wealth, <em>M</em> = 5.41;

In contrast, in the weak argument conditions, the Tashkentistani economy could only be viewed as benefiting from the EU, not the other way around:</button><blockquote><button class="sentence">Inclusion of a country into the EU leads to a chance at independence from outside influence, by providing security for the new country and changing its monetary system into the EU’s. </button><button class="sentence">EU members will aid in the building of new seaside ports, resulting in an extra hundred pounds of fish caught per week.</button></blockquote><button class="sentence"> However, this EU support for Tashkentistan was also described as coming at a price to EU countries.</button><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Within each argument, there were words that related to values pretested as important (i.e., self-respect) and unimportant (i.e., wealth). </button><button class="sentence">Yet the messages did not explicitly tie support for the advocacy to any of the values. </button><button class="sentence">That is, the messages did not say that supporting Tashkentistan would support self-respect or would support wealth. </button><button class="sentence">Therefore, the task of linking the value with a word from the message need not create attitudes viewed as expressing or representing the values.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Dependent Variables</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Appropriateness of values</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Study 1A participants were asked to rate how appropriate each value was for its message excerpt using a 9-point scale (1 = <em>not at all appropriate</em>, 9 = <em>very appropriate</em>).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Attitudes</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants reported their attitude toward Tashkentistan becoming a member of the EU on five semantic 9-point differential scales (1 = <em>harmful, foolish, bad, unfavorable</em>, and <em>undesirable</em>; 9 = <em>beneficial, wise, good, favorable</em>, and <em>desirable</em>, respectively), as well as rating how strongly they agreed with the message (1 = <em>strongly disagree</em>, 9 = <em>strongly agree</em>; see Wegener &amp; Fabrigar, 2004). </button><button class="sentence">The Cronbach’s alpha for these six items was .92 for Study 1A and .94 for Study 1B.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Thought favorability</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">After completing the attitude measures, participants completed a thought listing task. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were given 3 min to write down any thoughts they had while reading the message (see Wegener, Downing, Krosnick, &amp; Petty, 1995, for specific instructions). </button><button class="sentence">Two judges, unaware of condition, categorized participants’ thoughts as positive, negative, or neutral toward admitting Tashkentistan to the EU.
