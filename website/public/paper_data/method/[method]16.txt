<h3>Experiment 3 (Attentional Blink)</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The major obstacle to <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> discrimination between active and reactive inhibition is that the mechanisms can commonly be suspected to serve the same purpose: that is, to suppress unwanted information. This is true for the Simon task (Bialystok, 2006; Bialystok et al., 2004, 2005), where the aim of both active and reactive inhibitory mechanisms would be to suppress the often misleading (and task-irrelevant) stimulus location, and for the cuing task used in our Experiment 2, where it was just as reasonable to suppress the randomly varying cue location. To circumvent this logical problem, we thought of an <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> task in which active inhibition makes little sense but reactive inhibition is nevertheless likely to occur. According to our reasoning, tasks producing the so-called attentional blink (AB; Raymond, Shapiro, &amp; Arnell, 1992) meet these criteria.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The AB occurs when two masked (or otherwise difficult to identify) target stimuli appear in close temporal proximity, such as in RSVP (rapid serial visual presentation) tasks with varying lags between the two targets. If the first target (T1) is identified correctly, people have great difficulty in reporting the second target (T2) when it occurs within an interval of about 100–500 ms after T1. Despite minor (often rather metaphorically expressed) details, most of the available approaches assume that processing and consolidating T1 occupies attentional mechanisms to a degree that means too little attention is left for processing and consolidating T2 if it appears before the consolidation of T1 is complete (for an overview, see Shapiro, 2001). However, recent observations are inconsistent with the assumption of a structural bottleneck (Colzato, Spapè, Pannebakker, &amp; Hommel, 2007; Di Lollo, Kawahara, Ghorashi, &amp; Enns, 2005; Hommel et al., 2006). For instance, people can report more than two targets when these targets are presented in a sequence (Di Lollo et al., 2005), which suggests that it is the presence of distractors between two given targets that is responsible for the blink. Hence, at least part of the AB seems to represent a side effect of a mechanism that shields targets against the impact of distractors, as <strong data-auto="strong_text">does</strong> the mechanism sketched in Figure 1. Indeed, Shapiro, Schmitz, Martens, Hommel, and Schnitzler (2006) observed a trade-off between the amount of resources devoted to T1 processing and the probability of missing T2. In particular, participants who showed more attention-related brain activity while processing T1 were more likely to fail to report T2 in the blink interval. This finding fits with the observation that a more relaxed attitude toward the task <strong data-auto="strong_text">improves</strong> performance on T2 (Olivers &amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2005). It is also consistent with the finding that successful report of T2 in the interval that typically produces a blink is accompanied by a dramatic suppression of brain responses to the distractors that intervene between T1 and T2 (Gross et al., 2004). In other words, the AB reflects the efficiency of noise suppression. Taken altogether, these studies suggest that people differ in the amount of attention they devote to the processing of a selected target stimulus and that this difference directly translates into their ability or inability to process a temporally close stimulus.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Getting back to our main question, these findings mean that people can indeed be suspected to differ with respect to <strong data-auto="strong_text">how</strong> much support they provide for a to-be-selected stimulus event and/or <strong data-auto="strong_text">how</strong> much reactive inhibition this support exerts on competitors (Routes a and b in Figure 1). This support would vary even under conditions in which the competitor is also a target, a fact that renders the presence of active inhibition (Route c) implausible. If so, we would be in the position of making a counterintuitive and rather surprising prediction: To the degree that they produce stronger reactive inhibition, bilinguals should exhibit worse performance (that is, a greater blink) in the AB task than monolinguals should. We tested this prediction by comparing performance of bilinguals and monolinguals in a standard RSVP task with two target stimuli.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We recruited 18 volunteers for each of the two language groups by applying the criteria and matching procedures used in Experiment 1 (see Tables 1 and 2). The balanced bilingual group comprised 12 bilingual participants from Experiment 1 and 6 additional Dutch–English bilinguals. The monolingual group comprised 18 new participants. Three monolingual participants were excluded from the analysis because of excessive error rates (&gt;80%) on T1. <sup/> As in Experiments 1 and 2, the bilingual participants were tested in the Netherlands and the monolingual participants were tested in Spain.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus and stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment was controlled by a standard desktop computer. All stimuli were presented in a resolution of 800 × 600 pixels in 16-bit color on a 17-in. CRT that refreshed at 100 Hz. Participants were seated at a viewing distance of about 50 cm. The fixation mark (+) and all RSVP items were presented centrally in black on a gray background (RGB 128, 128, 128). Each item was set in 16-point Times New Roman font. Letters were drawn randomly without replacement from the full alphabet. Digits were drawn from 1 to 9.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the RSVP task, participants were asked to identify and report two digits (T1 and T2) presented in a stream of letter distractors. After they had read the instructions, which included a slow demonstration of the RSVP, and had indicated that they fully understood the task, participants were required to go through 24 trials of training. If more than 50% of the responses were incorrect during the training, the training runs were repeated.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">An initial fixation addition sign, which was shown for 2,000 ms, marked the beginning of each trial. After a blank interval of 250 ms, the RSVP commenced; it consisted of 20 items with a duration of 40 ms each and an interstimulus interval of 40 ms. A full session lasted 30 min and contained 360 trials (three locations of T1 × 4 lags × 30 repetitions). Lag was determined by the number of items between T1 and T2. We randomly varied T1 position between Positions 7, 8, and 9 of the stream to reduce the predictability of target onsets. T2 was presented directly thereafter (Lag 1) or after another two, four, or seven distractors (Lags 3, 5, and 8 successively; see Figure 5). Participants were to report both targets directly after the RSVP by pressing the corresponding digit key on the computer keyboard.<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/0151941efa740c4c23bc60d19f166464/5ebcb1ba/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-2-302-fig5a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-302-fig5a.gif" title="Figure 5.
