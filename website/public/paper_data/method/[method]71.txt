<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Experiment 2: Does an Implemental Mind-Set Decrease Attitude Ambivalence?</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In this experiment, participants were asked to report their subjective experience of ambivalence toward numerous objects. </span><span class="sentence">Prior to giving their evaluations, participants were induced into a deliberative, implemental, or a neutral mind-set. </span><span class="sentence">By adding the neutral mind-set control group, we can test whether any change in ambivalence that is observed is due to the implemental mind-set, deliberative mind-set, or both. </span><span class="sentence">Admittedly, it is difficult to make exact predictions about the outcome of each mind-set on ambivalence relative to a “neutral mind-set,” mainly because it is unclear whether such a neutral mind-set can be successfully created (see Armor &amp; Taylor, 2003, p. 89; Taylor &amp; Gollwitzer, 1995, p. 217, for similar discussions; also see Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963, p. 13). </span><span class="sentence">That is, even if a control group of individuals in a neutral mind-set were not given any instruction to adopt a deliberative or implemental mind-set, they might still spontaneously adopt a particular mind-set during the course of an experiment. </span><span class="sentence">Indeed, one possibility is that individuals in a neutral mind-set control group might be so focused on planning their next task in the experiment that they might exhibit no differences in ambivalence relative to individuals in an implemental mind-set but still exhibit reduced levels of ambivalence compared with individuals in a deliberative mind-set. </span><span class="sentence">Another possibility is that because individuals in neither a neutral nor a deliberative mind-set group are required to come to a decision on a particular end-state, both groups might exhibit similar levels of ambivalence while still exhibiting elevated levels compared with individuals in an implemental mind-set.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were 123 students (99 women, 24 men) enrolled in an introductory psychology course, who participated in partial fulfillment of a course requirement. </span><span class="sentence">We invited participants to take part in an e-mail study that involved getting students' perspective on several objects. </span><span class="sentence">All participants who signed up then received an e-mail with a computer program as an attachment that included the study materials. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told that they would be taking part in separate tasks that dealt with getting their perspective on things, with one task focused on how students think about personal problems and projects and the other task focused on the attitudes that students have toward things. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: deliberative, implemental, or neutral mind-set control group. </span><span class="sentence">There were 41 participants in each condition.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure and Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants assigned to the mind-set conditions were first induced into either a deliberative or an implemental mind-set for the first task and then had their ambivalence assessed toward a variety of objects for the second task. </span><span class="sentence">Participants assigned to the neutral mind-set condition responded to our dependent measure of ambivalence without being induced into a particular mind-set beforehand (see Gagné &amp; Lydon, 2001a, 2001b; Gollwitzer &amp; Kinney, 1989). </span><span class="sentence">Participants in our neutral mind-set condition were induced into a mind-set after reporting their attitude in order to be able to use the same cover story (i.e., “take part in two tasks”) for all participants.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Mind-set manipulation</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In this experiment, we created a deliberative and implemental mind-set by employing the personal problem versus project paradigm used in previous mind-set research (e.g., Gollwitzer, Heckhausen, &amp; Steller, 1990; Gollwitzer &amp; Kinney, 1989; Taylor &amp; Gollwitzer, 1995). </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, we activated a deliberative mind-set by asking participants to nominate a personal problem in their life and weigh the pros and cons of making or not making a personal change decision regarding that problem (e.g., “Should I move out of the dormitory?”). </span><span class="sentence">Participants listed both the potential positive and negative, short-term and long-term consequences of deciding one way or another on the problem they nominated. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast, we activated an implemental mind-set by asking participants to nominate a personal project in their life and plan the implementation of that project. </span><span class="sentence">Participants named a project that they intended to accomplish within the following 3 months (e.g., to move out of the dormitory) and then listed the five most crucial steps that they deemed necessary to implementing that project. </span><span class="sentence">After which, they indicated when, where, and how they wanted to perform those steps.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Dependent measure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We generated a list of 30 objects for this experiment (see Appendix C). </span><span class="sentence">Participants were simply asked to report how ambivalent they were toward each object. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, we measured participants' ambivalence by asking “How conflicted/ambivalent are your feelings and/or beliefs towards… .” </span><span class="sentence">Answers were given on a 6-point scale that ranged from 1 ( <em>not at all ambivalent</em>) to 6 ( <em>extremely ambivalent</em>). </span><span class="sentence">The order of each object was randomly determined for each participant. </span><span class="sentence">Given that we were specifically interested in assessing participants' general experience of ambivalence across different objects, we created a measure of ambivalence by averaging participants' responses to the 30 items (α = .85; see de Liver, Van der Pligt, &amp; Wigboldus, 2007).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After participants completed the computer program, an electronic file of their responses was e-mailed to the experimenter. </span><span class="sentence">They were then thanked and fully debriefed.</span></p>
