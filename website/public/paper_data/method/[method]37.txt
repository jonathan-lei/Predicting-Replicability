<h3>Study 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The goal of this study was to provide initial evidence for our main hypothesis that individuals with reduced <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">regulation</strong> resources exhibit a stronger tendency for confirmatory information processing (i.e., confirmatory information evaluation and search) than do individuals with unimpaired <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">regulation</strong> resources.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Forty-nine people (26 females and 23 males) participated in this study (ages ranging between 21 years and 55 years; <em>M</em> = 36.84, <em>SD</em> = 10.52). To circumvent a pure student sample, participants were recruited both at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich, Germany (LMU) and in a pedestrian zone near the university campus. Of the participants, 15 were students and 34 were nonstudents (26 employed, 8 <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-employed). The study was a one-factorial design with two experimental between-subjects conditions (low depletion of <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">regulation</strong> resources vs. high depletion of <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">regulation</strong> resources).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Material and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After participants arrived at the laboratory, they were told that they were going to participate in two different and completely unrelated studies. The first study dealt with person-perception (depletion manipulation), whereas the second study addressed information-perception of political information in the mass media (information evaluation and search). Participants learned that for efficiency reasons both experiments would be performed together in one experimental session.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The manipulation of <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">regulation</strong> utilized attention control and was similar to the type of manipulation successfully used by Gilbert, Krull, and Pelham, (1988); Schmeichel et al. (2003), and Fischer et al. (2007). All participants were asked to watch a 5 min video clip without sound effects that showed the former German foreign secretary <sup/> in a political interview. Participants were informed that this experiment addressed assessments of <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> characteristics on a nonverbal basis; participants would subsequently have to make person-perception assessments (see Schmeichel et al., 2003, p. 35) of this former foreign secretary. Besides the interview footage, the video clip contained a series of well-known short words (e.g., car, flower) appearing on the lower third of the screen. Each word was shown for about 10 s and was printed in white letters on a black background. The appearing words were not related to the interview. The depletion manipulation took place as follows: In the low depletion condition, participants did not receive any instructions concerning the appearing, irrelevant words nor were these words mentioned before participants started viewing the video clip. In contrast, in the high depletion condition, participants were instructed not to look at the irrelevant words that might appear on the bottom of the computer screen. In addition, participants in the high depletion condition were instructed to focus their attention back on the interview with the foreign secretary whenever they noticed that their attention had drifted to the words on the lower third of the screen (for a similar procedure, see Schmeichel et al., 2003). Subsequent to depletion manipulation, as manipulation checks, participants were asked (a) “to what extent the previous task was laborious” (0 = <em>not at all</em>, 10 = <em>extremely</em>) and (b) “to what extent they were able to concentrate during the previous task” (0 = <em>not at all</em>, 10 = <em>extremely</em>; reverse coded). Both variables were highly correlated (<em>r</em> = .60, <em>p</em> &lt; .001) and were thus collapsed into an overall scale of depletion.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, participants were asked to start working on the second task concerning political information in the mass media, which is a typical decision paradigm in research on biased information evaluation and search (cf. Fischer et al., 2005; Frey, 1986). Participants were told that while they were performing their task, the experimenter would prepare the questionnaires to be used in the person-perception task of the first study. Participants were informed that the <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> department of the LMU was conducting studies on the reception of political information in the mass media: The present research was to focus on processes of perception, understanding, and assessment of political information as presented in newspapers and magazines. Following this introduction, participants were asked which one of the two major German parties, Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (<strong data-auto="strong_text">Social</strong>-Democratic-Party of Germany; SPD) or Christlich Demokratische Union/Christlich Soziale Union (Christian Democratic Union/Christian <strong data-auto="strong_text">Social</strong> Union; CDU/CSU), they would vote for if elections were held tomorrow. This decision was the basis for categorizing standpoint-consistent and standpoint-inconsistent information. It was also the basis for all further analyses in which the factor type of decision was used (which is the case for all four experiments). Next, participants were given 12 pieces of political information in the form of main theses (two to three sentences in length). Half of these were consistent and half were inconsistent with the participants' political preference (note that consistent pieces of information were those that go along with the participants' political opinion, and inconsistent pieces of information were those that ran counter to the participants' political opinion). They were told that lengthier newspaper articles existed for each of the main theses and could be read in detail after completion of the experiment. Of the 12 main theses, 3 were consistent and 3 were inconsistent with the politics of the SPD, and 3 were consistent and 3 were inconsistent with the politics of the CDU/CSU. An example of a piece of information consistent with the SPD was, “The SPD has performed well over the last few months. Many important reforms have been initiated, and the increase in public debts has been halted.” A piece of information inconsistent with the politics of the CDU/CSU was, “The current leaders of the CDU/CSU are not prepared for the political problems facing Germany. Instead of overcoming Germany's economic problems, they conduct tasteless personal attacks on politicians from other parties.” In sum, independent from their specific political opinion, participants were confronted with 6 pieces of information that were consistent with their political opinion (i.e., pieces of information that go along with their political opinion) and 6 pieces of information that were inconsistent with their political opinion (i.e., pieces of information that run counter to their political opinion). Participants were asked to evaluate the quality of each article according to its credibility (0 = <em>not at all</em>, 10 = <em>definitely</em>) and importance (0 = <em>not at all</em>, 10 = <em>definitely</em>). Ratings of credibility and importance were highly correlated (<em>r</em> = .89, <em>p</em> &lt; .001) and were thus collapsed into one scale of information evaluation. After the participants had finished the information evaluation task, the experimenter collected the evaluation questionnaires.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the last part of the experiment, participants were given the same 12 main theses (6 consistent and 6 inconsistent with their political opinion) on an extra sheet of paper to prevent demand effects between information evaluation and information search. They were asked to indicate which articles they wanted to read in more detail. Participants were allowed to select freely among the available pieces of information (i.e., they could select between no information and 12 pieces of information). Note that in none of the present studies did participants actually receive the information they selected. Note also that because preexisting political attitudes instead of spontaneously made decisions were assessed, we did not expect any attitude changes from pre- to postinformation evaluation and search. Thus, no final attitude was measured. The same applies to Study 4. After completing the experiment, participants were informed of the experimental hypotheses, thanked for their participation, and dismissed.</p>
