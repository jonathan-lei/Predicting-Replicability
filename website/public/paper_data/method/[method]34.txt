(2007).</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Measures</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>IAT (Greenwald et al., 1998)</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">The IAT assesses associations among two concept categories (e.g., Reemolap and Vabbenif) and two evaluative attributes (e.g., good and bad, the attributes used in this study) by requiring that participants categorize stimulus items representing the four categories as quickly as possible using two keys of a computer keyboard. </span><span class="sentence">Participants used the “e” and “i” keys to classify items one at a time into the corresponding superordinate categories identified on the right or left side of the screen. </span><span class="sentence">At each session, participants completed an IAT for either the original people or the new people.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">The IATs consisted of seven blocks of trials, following the recommendation of Nosek, Greenwald, and Banaji (2005). </span><span class="sentence">We analyzed the response latencies using the <i>D</i> algorithm (Greenwald, Nosek, &amp; Banaji, 2003). </span><span class="sentence">Response latency was calculated from the beginning of the trial until the time of a correct response, and latencies less than 400 ms were removed. </span><span class="sentence">A positive <i>D</i> score indicates an implicit preference consistent with the attitude induction—that is, a preference for the individual who was associated with positive information (original-people condition) or a preference for the new individual who belonged to the same group as the original person associated with positive information (new-people condition).</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Self-Report Measures</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">At each session, explicit attitudes were measured with 8-point semantic differential ratings for either the original individuals or the new individuals. </span><span class="sentence">The following traits were rated: unintelligent-intelligent, unpopular-popular, unlikeable-likeable, unfriendly-friendly, and unpleasant-pleasant. </span><span class="sentence">Participants also reported their global liking for each of the individuals (“How much do you like … ?”) on a 7-point scale ranging from <i>dislike very much</i> to <i>like very much</i>. </span><span class="sentence">Reliability among ratings was high (Cronbach's α = .89), so they were averaged into a single rating for each individual.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Manipulation Check</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">At the end of the first session, participants were asked to identify the four individuals to whom they were introduced by matching names and pictures. </span><span class="sentence">Two percent of participants failed this manipulation check. </span><span class="sentence">The substantive results were unchanged when these participants were excluded from analysis.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Procedure</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>First Session</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">The attitude-induction procedure was designed to create a clear preference for one individual over the other. </span><span class="sentence">Participants viewed a series of sentences describing behaviors performed by Reemolap and Vabbenif. </span><span class="sentence">Each sentence was accompanied by a picture of the individual, counterbalanced across participants, who performed that behavior. </span><span class="sentence">Reemolap performed predominantly positive behaviors (12 positive, 4 negative), and Vabbenif performed predominantly negative behaviors (12 negative, 4 positive). </span><span class="sentence">The name-behavior pairs were adapted from Hamilton and Gifford (1976; e.g., Reemolap visited a sick friend in the hospital, and Vabbenif parked in a space reserved for the handicapped). </span><span class="sentence">Each name-behavior pair appeared on a computer screen for 3 s. </span><span class="sentence">The induction procedure took approximately 3 min.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Next, participants were introduced to the new people. </span><span class="sentence">Bosaalap and Ibbonif were described as belonging to the same groups as Reemolap and Vabbenif—Laapians and Niffians, respectively. </span><span class="sentence">Both groups were described as diverse groups with many members who perform all different types of behaviors. </span><span class="sentence">The information distinguishing the new individuals consisted of a cartoon picture showing both and these descriptions:</span></p><div class="quote"><p><span class="sentence">Ibbonif is a sculptor and very much enjoys gardening, biking, and playing card games. </span><span class="sentence">Ibbonif is kind and thoughtful, but tends to be slightly greedy at times.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Bosaalap is a painter and very much enjoys cooking, hiking, and listening to music. </span><span class="sentence">Bosaalap is warm and considerate, but tends to be slightly dishonest at times.</span></p></div><p><span class="sentence">In pretesting, these descriptions were judged to be evaluatively equivalent. </span><span class="sentence">The cartoon images of the original and new individuals had a general resemblance consistent with the group memberships. </span><span class="sentence">Picture-description pairings were randomized across participants and did not affect the results.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Finally, participants were randomly assigned to complete the implicit and explicit attitude measures about either the original people (Reemolap and Vabbenif) or the new people (Bosaalap and Ibbonif). </span><span class="sentence">The order of the implicit and explicit measures was randomized across participants and did not influence the results.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Second Session</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">At the end of the first session, 92% of participants indicated their willingness to be contacted by e-mail for a follow-up session. </span><span class="sentence">These participants were e-mailed a link to the follow-up session 3 days later (days between sessions: <i>M</i> = 10, <i>SD</i> = 7, <i>Mdn</i> = 6, mode = 5). </span><span class="sentence">The length of time between the first and second sessions did not moderate any results.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to complete the implicit and explicit attitude measures toward either the original people or the new people. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, roughly half the participants completed the attitude measures for the same people at the first and second sessions, and the other half completed the attitude measures for different people at the two sessions. </span><span class="sentence">Whether they completed attitude measures for the same or different people at the first and second sessions did not qualify the results.</span></p>
