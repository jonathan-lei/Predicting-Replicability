<h3>Experiment 1: Immediate Versus Delayed Naming</h3><br/> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Sixty-four native English speakers, students at Harvard University, participated in the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">Half participated in the immediate naming condition, half in the delayed naming condition. </span><span class="sentence">All were paid for their participation.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Forty pictures of common objects were selected from Snodgrass and Vanderwart's (1980) picture database and were scaled to fit within a 245-pixels wide × 240-pixels high rectangle. </span><span class="sentence">Half the pictures had low frequency names (range = 1–9 per million), and half had high frequency names (range = 72–724 per million). </span><span class="sentence">Properties of the pictures and their names in the low and high frequency conditions are presented in Table 1. </span><span class="sentence">A related word was selected for each picture, and the unrelated items were created by re-pairing each word with an unrelated picture from the other frequency category. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, the same words appeared in the semantically related and unrelated conditions (see Appendix A). </span><span class="sentence">In the design there were two crossed experimental variables (i.e., frequency and semantic relatedness) with two levels of each variable. </span><span class="sentence">Each cell in the design had 20 items, leading to a total of 80 experimental items. </span><span class="sentence">For each experimental item the distractor word was colored blue. </span><span class="sentence">For the filler items the color of the distractor words was red. </span><span class="sentence">Participants' task in both immediate and delayed naming conditions alternated unpredictably between picture naming and distractor word reading on the basis of the color of the distractor word, with blue distractors designating picture naming and red distractors designating word reading.</span><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-1-249-tbl1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-249-tbl1a.gif"/><em>Properties of Low Frequency and High Frequency Items in Experiment 1</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A total of 160 items were included in each naming condition (immediate and delayed). </span><span class="sentence">Twelve additional pictures and words were selected to form 36 practice items. </span><span class="sentence">Distractor words were assigned to pictures and were colored appropriately such that 18 picture naming and 18 word reading items were created.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experimental and filler items were pseudorandomized into four blocks of trials. </span><span class="sentence">Within a given block there were an equal number of each condition, and each picture appeared once per block, either in the experimental or in the filler condition. </span><span class="sentence">Care was taken that (a) on consecutive trials there was no semantic or phonological relationship between pictures' names or distractor words, and (b) no more than three consecutive trials were from the same condition. </span><span class="sentence">The order of the blocks was counterbalanced according to an orthogonal Latin-square design into four lists.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment was controlled by DMDX software (Forster &amp; Forster, 2003). </span><span class="sentence">There were three phases in the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">In the first phase, participants were familiarized with all of the pictures and their names. </span><span class="sentence">In this phase, on each trial, a fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced with the picture for 2,000 ms. After 1,000 ms, the picture name appeared beneath the picture and cued the participant to pronounce the picture name aloud. </span><span class="sentence">The second phase consisted of 36 trials in which the experimental task was practiced. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to name pictures or words depending on the color of the word. </span><span class="sentence">If the word was colored blue they were instructed to name the picture; whereas if the word was colored red they were to read the word. </span><span class="sentence">The third phase was the experiment proper. </span><span class="sentence">The trial structure of the second and third phases was identical.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants either took part in the delayed or in the immediate naming condition. </span><span class="sentence">Participants in the delayed naming condition were instructed to postpone their naming response until the distractor word was presented. </span><span class="sentence">On each trial in the delayed naming condition, a fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced by a picture. </span><span class="sentence">After the picture was presented for 1,000 ms, the distractor word appeared. </span><span class="sentence">The pictures and distractor words remained on the screen for 500 ms. An empty screen was then displayed for 1,000 ms. Participants in the immediate naming condition were instructed to name the picture or word upon presentation (depending on the color of the word). </span><span class="sentence">The trial structure for the immediate naming condition was identical except for the fact that the distractor appeared simultaneously with the presentation of the picture. </span><span class="sentence">The picture and distractor remained on the screen for 500 ms. The participant initiated the next trial by pressing the space bar. </span><span class="sentence">The duration of the experiment was about 25 min.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Only the picture naming trials were analyzed. </span><span class="sentence">Three types of responses were excluded from the analysis of response times (RTs): (a) naming errors, (b) verbal disfluencies (stuttering, utterance repairs, production of nonverbal sounds), (c) recording failures, and (d) RTs below 300 or above 3,000 ms (immediate naming, 4.7%; delayed naming, 5.3%). </span><span class="sentence">RTs exceeding a cutoff value (defined as a participant's and an item's mean plus three standard deviations) were replaced by the cutoff value (immediate naming, 2.0%; delayed naming, 4.4%).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the analyses reported here we distinguish between by-subjects (<em>F</em><em>1</em>) and by-items (<em>F</em>2) analyses. </span><span class="sentence">For the <em>F</em>1 analyses we treat frequency and semantic relatedness as within-subjects variables. </span><span class="sentence">For the <em>F</em>2 analyses we treat frequency as a between-subjects variable and semantic relatedness as a within-subjects variable. </span><span class="sentence">We report separate analyses for the immediate and delayed naming conditions. </span><span class="sentence">An overview of RTs for each naming condition is presented in Table 2.</span><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-1-249-tbl2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-249-tbl2a.gif"/><em>Average Naming Latencies in Milliseconds (and Error Percentages) for Immediate (0 ms) and Delayed (1,000 ms) Naming Conditions of Experiment 1</em></p>
