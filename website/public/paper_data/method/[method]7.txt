<h3>Study 1: Affective Coherence Between Concepts and Motor Behavior</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The first study investigated affective recall as a function of primed mental content and motivationally relevant approach–avoidance behaviors. </button><button class="sentence">We predicted that the coherence between such actions and the content of currently accessible thoughts should facilitate information processing.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The relevance of such actions to recall was previously demonstrated by Förster and Strack (1997, 1998), who asked participants to generate the names of liked, disliked, or neutral persons while engaging in either arm flexion (approach action) or arm extension (avoidance action). </button><button class="sentence">Förster and Strack (1997) reasoned that the positive–negative associations to approach–avoidance behaviors and affective evaluation would lead to biased memory search. </button><button class="sentence">Indeed, arm flexion was associated with the generation of more positive names, and arm contraction was associated with the generation of more negative names. </button><button class="sentence">The second set of investigations (Förster &amp; Strack, 1998) identified an important boundary condition for arm contraction effects— the presence of an affective, evaluative context. </button><button class="sentence">As previously noted by Cacioppo et al. (1993), Förster and Strack (1998) found that the effect of arm contraction on memory retrieval occurred only during an evaluative task such as generating the names of liked, disliked, or neutral persons. </button><button class="sentence">When names were generated first and subsequently evaluated during arm contraction, no effect was found.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Recent results from studies by Centerbar and Clore (2006) further clarified such approach–avoidance motor effects. </button><button class="sentence">They extended the original work of Cacioppo and colleagues (1993) by showing that the effect of approach–avoidance motor action on evaluation of ideographs depended on subtle pre-existing differences in the affective valence of the ideographs. </button><button class="sentence">In contrast to the original work by Cacioppo and colleagues (1993), both an approach action with positive ideographs and a withdrawal action with negative ideographs produced more positive attitudes toward the ideographs. </button><button class="sentence">Avoidance did not lead to more negative attitudes, as previous data would have suggested. </button><button class="sentence">Centerbar and Clore (2006) explained this result in terms of a motivational compatibility model. </button><button class="sentence">Approach is a motivationally compatible action for positive stimuli, and avoidance is a motivationally compatible action for negative stimuli. </button><button class="sentence">Motivationally compatible actions produced more favorable attitudes than incompatible ones, with no evidence of a main effect of arm contraction. </button><button class="sentence">Further, no effect of arm contraction was found with neutral ideographs, a finding that further supports the compatibility interpretation.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Centerbar and Clore (2006) found additionally that motivationally compatible actions affected not only evaluations of the focal stimuli (ideographs) but also, under some conditions, evaluations of the pleasantness of the arm contractions themselves. </button><button class="sentence">Thus, the stimulus–action combination may produce an experience of fluency, or positive affect, which can then affect evaluation of one's own momentary experience. </button><button class="sentence">This suggests that such motivationally compatible actions might produce an experience of ease that could facilitate ongoing processing more generally.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">In the present studies, we therefore hypothesized that the effects of approach–avoidance actions should again depend on the interaction of the action and the valence of primed affective concepts. </button><button class="sentence">We predicted that this interaction should influence the ease of processing and later recall of events from a story. </button><button class="sentence">We subtly primed participants with happy, sad, or neutral words, using a scrambled sentences task. </button><button class="sentence">To the extent that primed concepts elicit tendencies to approach or avoid, as shown by Solarz (1960) and Chen and Bargh (1999), we predicted that people's particular actions would be motivationally compatible or incompatible experiences. </button><button class="sentence">The combinations of approach with positive primes or avoidance with negative primes should be affectively coherent, thereby facilitating processing of affective material during the memory task. </button><button class="sentence">Alternatively, combinations of approach actions with negative primes or avoidance actions with positive primes should be affectively incoherent, disrupting efficient processing and recall. </button><button class="sentence">Since neutral primes should have no implications for approach–avoidance action, we expected no effects in the neutral prime condition.</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were 59 undergraduate students (33 men, 26 women) from the University of Virginia psychology participant pool who took part in exchange for course credit. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were tested individually and in small groups (up to 4 at a time). </button><button class="sentence">The data of 3 participants were excluded from analyses because they did not follow instructions, leaving data for 56 participants (32, men, 24 women).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were informed that they would engage in various tasks, including isometric exercises involving their nondominant arm. </button><button class="sentence">The cover story (adapted from Friedman &amp; Förster, 2000) suggested that the arm positions were related to differential brain hemispheric activation. </button><button class="sentence">The experimenter demonstrated the correct arm position for both arm flexion and arm extension and explained that for arm flexion, the participant should bend the arm at the elbow to make a 90° angle, place the palm of the hand under the tabletop, and press lightly against the bottom edge of the table. </button><button class="sentence">For arm extension, the participant was told to extend the arm straight, place the palm on the tabletop, and apply a small amount of pressure against the tabletop. </button><button class="sentence">A booklet contained instructions for the following tasks.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Priming procedure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The scrambled sentences task (adapted from Costin, 1969) involved 40 strings of four words. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were to underline any three words in each string that could be combined to form a sentence. </button><button class="sentence">A practice item illustrated that for each item, there were two ways to combine three of the four words to complete a sentence. </button><button class="sentence">For example, the word string “the book close read” could be combined to form either “close the book” or “read the book.” </button><button class="sentence">Participants were asked to work quickly. </button><button class="sentence">The arm movements were not performed during the priming task.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of three priming conditions (happy, sad, or neutral). </button><button class="sentence">In the happy and sad conditions, half of the 40 items were valenced, and half were neutral. </button><button class="sentence">Valenced items included such strings as “kids played smiled happily” and “depressed seemed they you.” </button><button class="sentence">An example of a neutral string is “the book close read.”</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Recall task</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Subsequently, participants read a story (adapted from Bower, Gilligan, &amp; Monteiro, 1981) about a fictional character, “Paul.” </button><button class="sentence">In the story, Paul relates 10 happy and 10 sad events from his past. </button><button class="sentence">On the basis of random assignment, participants engaged in one of the two previously demonstrated arm positions as they read the story.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Afterward, participants completed two filler tasks—drawing a picture of the continental United States and counting backwards from 200 by 3's. </button><button class="sentence">Next, they answered questions about Paul, the character in the story. </button><button class="sentence">They judged Paul's happiness and sadness on scales from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 10 (<em>extremely</em>) and answered two liking questions: “How favorable do you feel toward Paul?” (−5 = <em>extremely unfavorable</em>, 5 = <em>extremely favorable</em>), and “How much do you think that you would like Paul if you were to get to know him” (−5 = <em>not at all</em>, 5 = <em>very much</em>). </button><button class="sentence">After completing these judgments, participants had 5 min to write down as many of the events as they could recall from the story about Paul.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Reported feelings</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">After completing the recall task, participants rated their current feelings using 15 affect-related words. </button><button class="sentence">They indicated, on a scale from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 9 (<em>extremely</em>), how much they were currently experiencing the following feelings: “calm,” “sad,” “relieved,” “happy,” “anxious,” “cheerful,” “relaxed,” “aroused,” “pleased,” “distressed,” “nervous,” “miserable,” “delighted,” “stimulated,” and “gloomy.” </button><button class="sentence">They then rated their overall mood (“How positive or negative overall do you feel right now?”) on a scale from 1 (<em>extremely negative</em>) to 9 (<em>extremely positive</em>). </button><button class="sentence">They also rated the arm movement task in terms of pleasantness (1 = <em>very unpleasant</em>, 9 = <em>very pleasant</em>) and effort (1 = <em>not at all effortful</em>, 9 = <em>very effortful</em>). </button><button class="sentence">Participants further indicated how enjoyable the scrambled sentences task was (1 = <em>not at all enjoyable</em>, 9 = <em>extremely enjoyable</em>). </button><button class="sentence">Finally, participants completed personality measures and answered open-ended questions probing for suspicions about the hypotheses.</button></p>
