<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were asked to take the role of a leading manager whose task is to purchase hardware equipment for an organization. The cover story said there were three providers—MediaCom, EMG, and Hi-Tech (in the following denoted P1, P2, and P3, respectively)—offering products in two domains (computers and telecommunication) and that former customers' positive and negative <strong data-auto="strong_text">experiences</strong> were stored in an exhaustive electronic database. Participants were free to gather as many observations from the database as they considered appropriate. The task focus was manipulated to induce forward inferences versus (diagnostic) backward inferences. Either forward comparative evaluations of the positivity of providers, p(+ / providers, domains), or backward diagnostic judgments of the providers responsible for negative outcomes, p(providers / –), were called for. Another manipulation, provider focus, consisted of the instruction to compare one specific provider, either P1 or P3, with the others. When the focus was on the most frequent provider, P1 (see Figure 1), input-bound information <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong> should accentuate the skewed provider base rates. When the focus was on the rarest provider, P3, the skew of provider base rates should be reduced, eliminated, or even reversed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The first prediction, to repeat, was that natural <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong> should be rare. Most participants should resort to selective <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong>, producing some mix of input-bound and output-bound <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong>. Second, a task focus on positive evaluation, p(+ / providers, domains), should induce predominantly input-bound <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong> (by providers and domains), and if output-bound search occurs, the focus should be on positive outcomes. In contrast, a task focus on diagnosing deficits, p(providers, domains / –), should encourage output-bound samples biased toward negative outcomes and, in the case of input-bound <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong>, enhanced interest in the focal provider. And third, depending on the degree of input-bound and output-bound <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong>—which can vary between instruction conditions and between individual judges—biases should carry over to backward and to forward judgments, respectively. More positive forward judgments are predicted when output-bound <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong> concentrates on positive outcomes, encouraged by a task focus on p(+ / providers, domains) rather than negative outcomes, given a focus on p(providers / –). The strength of these biases should correlate across judges with the strength of <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong> biases. Backward (diagnostic) judgments of the origins of negative outcomes, p(providers / –), should tend to attribute the origin to the most frequently encountered provider. Thus, the main target of diagnostic judgments should be P1 by default, and under P1 focus instructions in particular, but not (to the same degree) under P3 focus instructions. More generally, a focus on P1 as the provider of main interest should increase the skew of the database and thereby strengthen the association between P1 and other prevalent trends in the sample. A focus on P1 should strengthen attribution of negative outcomes to P1 in backward diagnostic judgments. A P1 focus may also strengthen the learned association of P1 and positive outcomes in forward evaluations. These tendencies should be attenuated or reversed when the focus is on P3.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Fifty-six male and female students of the University of Heidelberg participated either for course credit or for payment. They were randomly assigned to one of four groups representing all combinations of provider focus (on P1 vs. P3) and task focus (positive evaluation vs. diagnosing deficits).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants arrived alone or in groups of two to six. They were seated in front of separate computers that administered instructions, stimulus presentation, and dependent measures. Instructions consisted of the cover story—to play the role of a manager whose task is to find out the best provider for purchasing computers or telephone hardware, <strong data-auto="strong_text">based</strong> on former customers' positive and negative reactions concerning all three providers in both product domains. Then, in the specific part of the instructions, two aspects were manipulated—task focus and provider focus—between four <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> groups:
<br/><ol type="1"><li>In the positive evaluation, P<sub>1</sub> focus condition, judges were asked to make “forward evaluative inferences of the positivity of provider P<sub>1</sub> in comparison to other providers.”</li><li>In the positive evaluation, P<sub>3</sub> focus condition, judges were asked to make “forward evaluative inferences of the positivity of provider P<sub>3</sub> in comparison to other providers.”</li><li>In the diagnosing deficits, P<sub>1</sub> focus condition, judges had to make “backward inferences about causes of negative outcomes originating in P<sub>1</sub> compared to other providers.”</li><li>In the diagnosing deficits, P<sub>3</sub> focus condition, judges had to make “backward inferences about causes of negative outcomes originating in P<sub>3</sub> compared to other providers.”</li></ol></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The translated text in the Appendix shows that participants were explicitly instructed to make inferences about the evaluation of providers in the whole database, or inferences about the origins of deficits in the database, as distinguished from the sample. It was then explained at length that participants could sample as many observations as they liked, from the database in which the reactions of former customers had been stored. They were free to use any search strategy they wished. On every trial they could call for either an item drawn at random from the database (fully unconstrained) or an item about provider Px drawn at random from all Px entries in any domain or valence category, or any positive reaction from the computer domain, about any provider, or any other combination constrained in 0, 1, 2, or all 3 dimensions. A 2 × 3 × 2 cube was presented graphically on the screen, with the rows labeled “Computers” and “Telecommunication”; the columns labeled “MediaCom,” “EMG,” and “Hi-Tech”; and the foreground and background slices labeled “Positive” and “Negative.” Below the cube, the response keys that could be used to constrain <strong data-auto="strong_text">sampling</strong> in any subset of the three dimensions were marked in three rows (i.e., the Y and U keys in the upper row to select domain C or T, respectively; the G, H, and J keys in the middle row to select provider P1, P2, or P3, respectively; and the B and N keys to call for a positive or negative outcome, respectively). They could fix any value on any dimension or leave a dimension open. The graphical display supported the instructions such that when a certain value on a dimension was fixed, the other values disappeared (e.g., when domain C was chosen, only the upper row of the cube remained; when P1 was chosen, the other columns were removed from the display, etc.).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After the participant indicated his or her constraints, the computer randomly selected one out of all items in the database that met the constraints chosen. The database was the same population distribution as in the simulation above (see Figure 1). If the item drawn was positive, the computer selected a positive comment from a pool of 240, such as, “If one needs maintenance, somebody is immediately available.” If it was negative, the comment was selected from a pool of negative ones such as, “If one needs maintenance, nobody is available.” This item was presented for 3 s on the screen and then inserted in the cube position that corresponded to the domain, the provider, and the valence. Participants knew that they could terminate the information search at any time by pressing the Escape key.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Dependent measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The main dependent measures were percentage inferences from the sample observations to the database. Participants were reminded of the distinction between the sample they had drawn and the overall database, and they were then asked to infer the percentage of positive entries in the database concerning each provider: “What is your estimate of the proportion of positive information entries in the entire database (across product domains) for the provider MediaCom / EMG / Hi-Tech, over all information stored about this provider?” They were then asked to make, in addition to these forward inferences, backward inferences of the proportion of deficits that were due to each provider: “Now consider exclusively negative information. Please estimate what percentage of all negative information in the entire database originates in the provider MediaCom / EMG / Hi-Tech.” (The same backward inferences were solicited for the origins of positive outcomes, with similar results, not reported here).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">At the end of the session, the three-dimensional cube appeared again on the screen, just as during the stimulus presentation, and judges were asked to estimate (in cardinal frequencies) how many observations they had sampled from each cell of the 2 × 3 × 2 scheme. Although the judges were possibly influenced by the preceding inferences, these sample estimates were included if only to ensure that judges were aware of the distinction between the sample and the population.</p>
