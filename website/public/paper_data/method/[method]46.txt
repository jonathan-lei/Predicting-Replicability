<h3>Study 4</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In Study 4, we used a between-subjects design to test the effects of target gender and ethnicity on <strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong> recognition.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 211 undergraduate students (60% women) from the University of California, Davis, who participated in exchange for course credit. Participants self-identified their race as Asian (47%), Caucasian (31%), Latino (9%), African American (2%), and other or mixed (11%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The set of drawn figure targets that was developed for Study 3 was used.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants (<em>N</em> = 211) were randomly assigned to one of six ethnic–gender conditions. Participants in each condition viewed only a single target (African man, African woman, Asian man, Asian woman, Caucasian man, or Caucasian woman) showing all eight emotion expressions. Participants viewed each of the eight images, projected onto a large 4-ft × 6-ft (1.2-m × 1.8-m) screen, for 30 s. The order of the images was randomized. As in Study 3, participants were asked, for each image, to “choose the emotion that best matches the emotion expressed by the person in the slide” from the following list of options: <em>anger</em>, <em>contempt</em>, <em>disgust</em>, <em>fear</em>, <em>happiness</em>, <em><strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong></em>, <em>sadness</em>, <em>surprise</em>, and <em>none of these are correct</em>. Participants were also again asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (<em>not at all intense</em>) to 6 (<em>extremely intense</em>).</p>
