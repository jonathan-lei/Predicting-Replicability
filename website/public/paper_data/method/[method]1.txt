<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Study 5: Experimental Manipulation of Reflected Appraisals of Interpersonal Vulnerability</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The last study examined effects of experimentally manipulated reflected appraisals of vulnerability on doubts about the authenticity of a new acquaintance's emotional expression. </span><span class="sentence">Pataki and Clark (2004) hypothesized and found evidence that people publicly express more happiness than they privately feel to unattractive targets and that unattractive targets are aware of this. </span><span class="sentence">They posited that expressions of happiness ordinarily serve as expressions of social interest but that people may tailor these expressions to avoid hurting others' feelings. </span><span class="sentence">Moreover, as this is a normative tendency, targets of these exaggerated expressions of happiness, such as unattractive individuals, typically know that people tend to do this and, consequently, discount the meaningfulness of these expressions. </span><span class="sentence">We expected similar effects with reflected appraisals of vulnerability—people induced to believe that another person views them as especially insecure about and emotionally vulnerable to rejection should believe that the other expressed more happiness than he or she felt (a specific authenticity doubt; Path c in Figure 1).</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Overview</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were told that they would interact with another participant (really a confederate) and that this other person would be given information that may or may not be true about them beforehand. </span><span class="sentence">After a 10-min interaction, some participants were informed that the confederate had been told that the participant was especially insecure and emotionally vulnerable to rejection; some were not. </span><span class="sentence">We then measured participants' perceptions of the confederate's authenticity of expressions of happiness during the prior interaction.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">One hundred and eighty-six participants (86 men, 98 women, 2 who did not report gender; <em>M</em> age = 22 years), primarily college students, were recruited via campus advertisements, research experiment websites, and from a Psychology participant pool.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">As they arrived at the laboratory, participants walked by one of three confederates (two women, one man) who was apparently waiting in the hallway for an appointment. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter ushered the participant into a laboratory room and then provided a cover story, explaining that the experiment was about how first impressions can affect perceptions of social interactions, that the participant would have a brief interaction with another participant (really a confederate), and that the procedure required one of the two participants to receive information about the other participant before the interaction to examine the effects of first impressions. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter further explained to the true participant that, because he or she was the first to arrive at that session, the other participant (the confederate) would be the one to receive this information and that this information may or may not be true of the participant. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter also added that, to preserve the validity of the study, he could not disclose the details of the information (to the true participant) until the interaction was over but that he would be sure to explain the nature of the information at that time. </span><span class="sentence">After assuring that participants understood this information, the experimenter left the room, ostensibly to wait for the other participant and provide him or her the information. </span><span class="sentence">In reality, the confederate was not given any information about the participant and was unaware of the experimental condition.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A few minutes later, the experimenter returned to the room and ushered the confederate into a seat across from the participant. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter explained that the study was about how people perceive their social interactions, that they would have a semi-structured 10-min interaction, and that they then would go to separate rooms to complete measures of their perceptions of the interaction. </span><span class="sentence">After completing consent forms, participants completed a short questionnaire in which they provided demographic information and responses to a self-esteem scale. </span><span class="sentence">The confederate acted as if he or she also was completing the consent forms and questionnaire.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Following this, the participant and confederate took part in the Relationship Closeness Induction Task (RCIT), a 9-min guided and timed interaction task designed to induce feelings of closeness (Sedikides, Campbell, Reeder, &amp; Elliot, 1999). </span><span class="sentence">The task consists of three lists of questions presented on three separate pages. </span><span class="sentence">The questions gradually become more personal, with questions regarding things such as name, age, and hometown appearing on the first page, hobbies and personal goals on the second page, and childhood memories and emotional experiences on the third page. </span><span class="sentence">Participants and confederates took turns asking and answering each question. </span><span class="sentence">When they reached the time limit for the page, the experimenter returned to the room to prompt them to turn to the next page.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Once the participants were finished with the RCIT, the experimenter returned and explained that the interaction was over and that now participants would go to separate rooms to complete a survey assessing perceptions of the interaction. </span><span class="sentence">He then ushered the confederate out of the room.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">At this point, the procedure varied depending on random assignment to one of three experimental conditions. </span><span class="sentence">For participants assigned to the no-information control condition ( <em>n</em> = 62), the experimenter returned and administered the final questionnaire without saying anything about the information that had ostensibly been given to the other participant before the interaction.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">For those assigned to the reflected appraisals of vulnerability condition ( <em>n</em> = 63), the experimenter returned and explained that, now that the interaction was over, he could describe the information that he had given the other participant before the interaction. </span><span class="sentence">He then explained, “I told the other participant that you were sensitive about what other people think about you, that you care a lot about that sort of thing.” </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter then explained that the other participant had read a memo conveying this same information and provided the participant with a copy of the memo. </span><span class="sentence">On university letterhead, the memo read as follows:</span></p><blockquote><span class="sentence">Dear participant, you are about to interact with a very sensitive person. </span><span class="sentence">Based on prior in-depth interviews and completion of personality inventories, it appears that the participant with whom you are about to interact is extremely sensitive about how he/she comes across to others. </span><span class="sentence">This person constantly worries about what other people think, whether other people accept him/her, and whether other people will want to start a friendship. </span><span class="sentence">This person tends to perceive signs of rejection even in situations where people are accepting. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, this person is easily hurt and angered by signs of rejection from others. </span><span class="sentence">Sincerely, Research Staff.</span></blockquote><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experimenter explained that the other participant was in a room completing a survey assessing his or her perceptions of the interaction. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter added that he also wanted to assess the (real) participant's perceptions so that he could compare them with the other participant's responses. </span><span class="sentence">He then administered the final questionnaire.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A second control condition also was administered to control for other differences between the two conditions described above ( <em>n</em> = 61). </span><span class="sentence">For instance, factors such as activation of constructs related to vulnerability, sensitivity, and insecurity; suspicion or demand due to disclosure of information ostensibly given to the other participant; and a longer duration between the interaction and completion of dependent measures might serve as alternative explanations of our expected effect. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, we also desired to compare the vulnerable condition with an invulnerable condition that differed in terms of the reflected appraisal but did not differ in terms of these other factors. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, this condition allowed us to examine effects of inducing reflected appraisals of invulnerability, but we did not have strong predictions regarding such effects because participants in the no-information condition likely assumed that they were not viewed as vulnerable, which is what participants in the invulnerable condition were explicitly told. </span><span class="sentence">The experimenter explained that he had told the other participant before the interaction that “you were not sensitive to what other people think about you, that you could really care less about that sort of thing.” </span><span class="sentence">The memo read as follows:</span></p><blockquote><span class="sentence">You are about to interact with a very insensitive person. </span><span class="sentence">Based on prior in-depth interviews and completion of personality inventories, it appears that the participant with whom you are about to interact is extremely insensitive to social cues. </span><span class="sentence">This person is oblivious to what others are thinking, is largely unaware of social norms, and cares little about appearance. </span><span class="sentence">This person tends to be unaware of signs of rejection and acceptance from others. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, this person appears to be unaffected by what other people think, has little ability to take others' perspectives on things, and does not understand others' feelings.</span></blockquote><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Following completion of the final questionnaire, all participants were debriefed. </span><span class="sentence">One participant (in the reflected appraisals of vulnerability condition) expressed suspicion regarding the cover story. </span><span class="sentence">Preliminary analyses revealed that exclusion of this participant's responses did not alter the pattern of results. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, his responses were included in the analyses presented below.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Self-esteem</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants completed the Rosenberg (1965) Self-Esteem Scale using 4-point response scales (1 = <em>strongly disagree</em>; 4 = <em>strongly agree</em>; α = .90).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Expressed and felt happiness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Embedded in the final questionnaire was an item assessing the confederate's expression of happiness (“How much happiness did the participant in this study express toward you?”), followed by an item assessing the confederate's privately felt happiness (“How much happiness did the participant in this study really feel toward you?”). </span><span class="sentence">Participants completed these items on 7-point response scales (1 = <em>very little</em>; 7 = <em>a lot</em>).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Evaluation of vulnerable and invulnerable feedback</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">All participants were provided with the vulnerable and invulnerable descriptions in the memos and evaluated each on 7-point response scales (1 = <em>extremely negative</em>;
