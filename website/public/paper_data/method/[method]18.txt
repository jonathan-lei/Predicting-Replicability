<h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were 32 students in the last 2 years of high school, recruited from schools in Potsdam, Germany. </span><span class="sentence">They participated in two 1-hr sessions and were reimbursed with 12 €. </span><span class="sentence">They were assigned to one of two groups in alternating order.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The materials consisted of 400 one- and two-syllable German nouns. </span><span class="sentence">In each trial, six nouns were selected at random from this pool, with the constraint that the nouns have not been used as memory items in any previous trial of the same block. </span><span class="sentence">The six selected words were assigned at random to the six serial positions. </span><span class="sentence">The set of six words was subdivided into two lists. </span><span class="sentence">For participants in the long–short group, the first four words formed the first list, and the remaining two words formed the second list. </span><span class="sentence">For the short–long group, the first two words formed the first list and the other four words formed the second list.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Each of the two sessions consisted of eight blocks of 32 trials each. </span><span class="sentence">In each trial, the six words were presented centrally one by one for 700 ms, followed by a 100-ms blank interval. </span><span class="sentence">The first list of two or four words (depending on group) was displayed in red, and the second list was displayed in blue on a black background. </span><span class="sentence">Half a second following the offset of the last word, a red or blue frame appeared centrally; its color indicated which list should be regarded as relevant. </span><span class="sentence">The probe appeared in the frame 100 ms later in the same color as the frame. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were instructed to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether the probe was contained in the relevant list. </span><span class="sentence">They gave their responses by pressing on the left or the right arrow key. </span><span class="sentence">Immediate feedback followed a key press in the form of a brief high tone for correct responses and a low tone for incorrect responses. </span><span class="sentence">The next trial began 1.5 s after the feedback tone.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Half the probes were positive—that is, they were contained in the relevant list; 25% were new probes not contained in any present list or in any previous memory list of the same block; and 25% of probes were intrusion probes—that is, probes from the irrelevant list. </span><span class="sentence">Positive probes and intrusion probes were drawn in equal proportions from all serial positions of the relevant or the irrelevant list, respectively.</span></p>
