<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Experiment 1</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The reverse association is supported directly by two different experimental methodologies (Rickard, 2005; Rusconi et al., 2006) and also neatly explains the complex pattern of facilitative transfer effects observed in simple arithmetic (e.g., Campbell et al., 2006). </span><span class="sentence">In the present study, we sought converging evidence for the reverse association using a different transfer paradigm from that employed by Rickard (2005). </span><span class="sentence">In Rickard's transfer study (Experiment 1), participants received 40 practice blocks of alternating factoring problems (8 = ? × ?) and multiplication problems (3 × 4 = ?). </span><span class="sentence">During the subsequent multiplication test phase, participants received the items practiced by factoring (i.e., practiced 8 = ? × ? then tested on 2 × 4); the practiced multiplication problems; and new, unpracticed multiplication problems. </span><span class="sentence">Relative to new problems, factoring facilitated corresponding multiplication problems substantially; improvement was 59% of that observed from practicing multiplication. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, factoring appeared to strengthen the corresponding multiplication fact, although not as much as practicing multiplication. </span><span class="sentence">Rickard argued that the same memory structure is strengthened by factoring or multiplying but that there are also operation-specific processes that are strengthened, which results in larger savings for the same operation than if there were an operation change at test.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In Experiment 1, we attempted to extend the Rickard (2005) transfer results using a pretest–practice–posttest design. </span><span class="sentence">Rickard examined inter-operation transfer from factoring to multiplication only, but the IE-r model predicts that there also should be transfer from practicing multiplication to factoring. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, in Experiment 1, we examined effects of practicing multiplication (2 × 7 = ?) on performance of the same problem (2 × 7 = ?) and performance on the corresponding factoring problem (14 = _ × _ ?). </span><span class="sentence">One group of participants performed multiplication during the pretest and posttest, and the other group performed factoring. </span><span class="sentence">Both groups practiced only multiplication during the practice phase. </span><span class="sentence">During the pretest and posttest, three experimentally defined problem sets were tested: practiced problems (composed from a subset of four factors, either 2, 4, 7, 8 or 3, 5, 6, 9), unrelated problems (composed from the factor set not used for the practiced problems), and related problems (composed of one factor from the practice set and one not used for the practice set). </span><span class="sentence">During the practice phase, participants received 15 continuous blocks of the practice set presented as multiplication problems. </span><span class="sentence">This pretest–practice–posttest design allowed us to measure transfer from multiplication practice to the same multiplication problem and to the corresponding factoring problem, with the unrelated problems providing a control baseline. </span><span class="sentence">The related problems could be informative as well. </span><span class="sentence">Phenix and Campbell (2004) demonstrated that multiplication fact retrieval is subject to retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). </span><span class="sentence">RIF is the phenomenon whereby repeated retrieval of a subset of items results in increased retrieval difficulty for related items that were not practiced (Anderson, Bjork, &amp; Bjork, 2000; Anderson &amp; Green, 2001; Anderson, Green, &amp; McCulloch, 2000). </span><span class="sentence">Similarly, Phenix and Campbell found that repeatedly practicing some members of a times-table family (e.g., 7 × 2, 7 × 3, 7 × 4,…7 × 9) resulted in slower response times for other members of the family. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, comparing related and unrelated problems at posttest was expected to provide a measure of RIF in this experiment.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Twenty-eight volunteers (23 women, 5 men) were recruited from the participant pool organized by the Department of Psychology at the University of Saskatchewan. </span><span class="sentence">Participants ranged in age from 18 to 21 years ( <em>M</em> = 18.8), reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision and, received bonus credit in their introductory psychology course for participation.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment consisted of three phases, including a pretest, practice, and posttest. </span><span class="sentence">There were two pretest and three posttest blocks in which all 21 multiplication problems were presented in a random order. </span><span class="sentence">During the pretest and posttest, participants in the factoring group received the product (e.g., 56) and typed in the corresponding factors (7 8) in either order. </span><span class="sentence">Multiplication participants received the factors (7 × 8) and typed the correct product (56). </span><span class="sentence">Odd or even participant number determined assignment to the factoring or multiplication group. </span><span class="sentence">During the practice phase, participants received 15 continuous blocks of seven practice-set problems, in random order, presented as multiplication problems.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Among the 21 problems tested in the pretest and posttest phases, there were the seven practice-set problems, seven unrelated problems composed from operands not used for the practice set, and seven related problems that included one operand used for the practice set. </span><span class="sentence">To create these sets, seven problems were composed from the factors 2, 4, 7, and 8 (8 = 4 × 2, 14 = 7 × 2, 28 = 7 × 4, 32 = 8 × 4, 49 = 7 × 7, 56 = 7 × 8, 64 = 8 × 8) and seven others from the factors 3, 5, 6, and 9 (15 = 5 × 3, 25 = 5 × 5, 27 = 9 × 3, 30 = 6 × 5, 45 = 9 × 5, 54 = 9 × 6, 81 = 9 × 9). </span><span class="sentence">Assignment of these two sets to the practice and unrelated conditions was counterbalanced across participants. </span><span class="sentence">Practice and unrelated problems were unrelated in virtue of sharing no common factor. </span><span class="sentence">Seven related problems were composed that contained one factor that appeared in the practice set and one that did not appear in the practice set. </span><span class="sentence">All participants received the same related problem set, which included 6 = 3 × 2, 10 = 5 × 2, 20 = 5 × 4, 21 = 7 × 3, 42 = 7 × 6, 48 = 8 × 6, 72 = 9 × 8. </span><span class="sentence">Although absolute performance on the related set cannot be compared with the practice and unrelated sets because of the possibility that the related set differs in difficulty from the other two, changes in performance for the related set between pretest and posttest can be meaningfully interpreted (cf. Phenix &amp; Campbell, 2004). </span><span class="sentence">Multiplication problems always appeared with the larger factor on the left. </span><span class="sentence">All problems were presented horizontally in white characters against a dark background. </span><span class="sentence">Characters were approximately 3 mm wide by 5 mm high.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment required approximately 30 min and took place in a quiet room with a researcher present. </span><span class="sentence">An IBM-type computer was used, with two high-resolution monitors to display stimuli. </span><span class="sentence">The researcher sat behind the participant, and each viewed a separate monitor. </span><span class="sentence">The instructions for the task emphasized both speed and accuracy. </span><span class="sentence">Factoring participants were instructed to use the numbers 2 through 9 as factors and were informed that factor order did not matter. </span><span class="sentence">Participants entered their responses using the number pad on the computer keyboard. </span><span class="sentence">RT was measured from stimulus onset to the final keystroke.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">To begin each trial, a fixation dot appeared in the center of the screen for 1 s, then flashed twice. </span><span class="sentence">The problem appeared on what would have been the third flash. </span><span class="sentence">Multiplication problems occupied a seven-character field (e.g., 7 × 2), with the multiplication sign at fixation. </span><span class="sentence">For factoring problems, the stimulus (e.g., 14) appeared with the leftmost character at fixation. </span><span class="sentence">The problem remained on the screen until the participant had completed their response. </span><span class="sentence">Presentation of problems within each block was continuous, but participants received a short break after the pretest–posttest and practice phases. </span><span class="sentence">Participants did not receive feedback about speed or accuracy.</span></p>
