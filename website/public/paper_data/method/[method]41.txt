<h4>Study 6</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Studies 1–5 provide converging evidence that parental <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> can play an important role in <strong data-auto="strong_text">terror</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">management</strong> processes. However, in Studies 2 and 3, both parental primes and close friend or romantic partner primes were found to mitigate the consequences of MS. This leads to the question of how parental <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> relates to other types of attachments and what leads a person to preferentially rely on one or the other type of <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> when his or her need for security is heightened. Although all <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> theories posit that the initial bond with one's <strong data-auto="strong_text">parents</strong> or primary caregivers forms the basis on which later relationships are founded, the present studies are the first to document the continued use of these primary <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> relationships to control existential anxiety in adult life. But given that young <strong data-auto="strong_text">adults</strong> have now been shown to use their romantic partners, close friends, and <strong data-auto="strong_text">parents</strong> as bulwarks against death-related anxiety, questions about the determinants of which others are selected for such protection must be addressed. As an initial step in this direction, Study 6 explored the role of <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> security in producing such preferences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore relative preferences for different <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> figures in response to threat. After a copious literature search, we could find no studies that compared preferences for the solace of different relationship types as a function of an individuals' <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> style. Addressing this question poses a methodological challenge: How to assess participants' relationship preferences among a number of simultaneously available options. To this end, we created a purported marketing survey wherein participants were asked to allocate minutes on a cell phone calling plan to each of four different relationship persons (i.e., parent, sibling, romantic partner, close friend). Following previous TMT research (Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 2000), we hypothesized that low levels of <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> anxiety and avoidance (<strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> security) would predict increased preference for close relationships with romantic partners. Conversely, after MS, insecurely attached individuals should report increased preference for a parent. However, we predicted that this effect would be specific to those with high levels of <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> anxiety and low levels of <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> avoidance, since previous research has found that such individuals have problems transferring <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> functions from <strong data-auto="strong_text">parents</strong> to subsequent relationships (e.g., Allen &amp; Land, 1999; Mayseless, 2004). Highly avoidant individuals seem not to value attachments generally (Fraley, Davis, &amp; Shaver, 1998), so we doubted whether they would rely on <strong data-auto="strong_text">parents</strong> or any other <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> figures after MS.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Participants</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 100 students (56 women, 44 men) recruited from introductory <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> classes at the University of Missouri—Columbia in exchange for partial course credit. Ages ranged from 18 to 26 years (<em>M</em> = 19.07, <em>SD</em> = 1.33).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Materials and Procedure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The study was conducted in a laboratory setting. All packets were identical in content except for the MS manipulation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em><strong data-auto="strong_text">Attachment</strong></em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants completed Griffin and Bartholomew's (1994b) 30-item Relationship Scales Questionnaire as part of a mass screening session approximately 2 weeks prior to their participation in the study. Previous research attests to the scale's reliability and validity (e.g., Griffin &amp; Bartholomew, 1994a, 1994b; Kurdek, 2002). Given the present interest in preferences among different relationships, one advantage of this particular scale is that it measures general <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> styles as opposed to those tied to a specific type of (e.g., romantic) relationship. Items were presented on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>not at all like me</em>) to 5 (<em>very like me</em>). Since most researchers currently suggest that <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> should be measured in relation to two distinct <strong data-auto="strong_text">attachment</strong> dimensions (see, e.g., Fraley &amp; Waller, 1998), we calculated separate anxiety (e.g., “I worry about being abandoned”; α = .81) and avoidant (e.g., “I find it difficult to trust others completely”; α = .72) scores following procedures recommended by Kurdek (2002; see also Simpson, Rholes, &amp; Nelligan, 1992).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>MS manipulation</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Following filler measures to maintain the cover story, participants completed the same MS–dental pain manipulation and delay tasks described previously.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Cell phone task</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The dependent measure was a cell phone minute allocation task that we created to assess preference for various relationships. Specifically, participants were presented with a questionnaire described as a “Consumer Behavior and Marketing Survey.” To maintain the cover story for the task, we told participants,
<blockquote>Recent evidence suggests that observing people's attitudes and behaviors toward certain products can be very informative. By having a fuller sense of how people use a product, researchers gain important insight into how people make decisions and what they look for.</blockquote> The instructions further stated that everyone was randomly assigned to evaluate a common, everyday household product; actually, all participants completed the same cell phone calling plan evaluation. The instructions read,
<blockquote>Imagine you are given a cell phone with 100 minutes allotted to you per week. These are whenever minutes, so you can call anyone at anytime without additional fees or penalties; however, you must partition these minutes in advance. In the space below, indicate how you would partition (or breakdown) your 100 minutes. That is, please indicate how many minutes that you would use to call each of the following people. Keep in mind that your total time should add up to 100 minutes.</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Following the instructions, participants were presented with four relationships: parent, sibling, romantic partner, and a close friend. A blank space was placed next to each relationship, and participants were asked to indicate the number of minutes they would use to call each person. We counterbalanced the presentation order of relationships to control for order effects. The dependent measure consisted of the number of minutes allocated to each of the four relationships.</p>
