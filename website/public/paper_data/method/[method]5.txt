Stimuli were leftward-, rightward-, upward-, and downward-pointing arrows appearing to the left, to the right, above, or below the central fixation point. In the ongoing task (regular trials), participants responded either to the directions of the arrows (as in the examples shown here) or to the locations of the arrows. PM cues were defined (in different blocks) either as any arrow appearing below the fixation point, regardless of its direction (as in the examples on the right), or as any arrow pointing downward, regardless of its location (as in the examples on the left). Thus, PM cues were defined either by the response-relevant or by the response-irrelevant stimulus dimension of the ongoing task. Some regular trials were PM-related trials, on which the stimulus was not the actual PM cue, but was semantically related to that cue (i.e., a downward-pointing arrow at the top, right, or left location when the PM cue was defined as an arrow in the bottom location, or a leftward-, rightward-, or upward-pointing arrow at the bottom location when the PM cue was defined as a downward-pointing arrow).</p></div></div></div><p><span class="sentence">In addition, subjects were instructed that on some trials, a PM cue would appear, and that this cue required a different response (pressing the space bar). </span><span class="sentence">There were two different types of PM cues. </span><span class="sentence">In half of the blocks, the PM cue was any arrow appearing at a particular location (i.e., below the fixation point), regardless of the direction in which the arrow pointed. </span><span class="sentence">In the remaining blocks, the PM cue was any arrow pointing in a particular direction (downward), regardless of its location. </span><span class="sentence">We term these <i>location PM cues</i> and <i>arrow PM cues</i>, respectively. </span><span class="sentence">Each subject in each of the two ongoing-task groups (i.e., those performing the arrow task and those performing the location task) received a total of six blocks, three with arrow PM cues and three with location PM cues (order of blocks was counterbalanced across subjects). </span><span class="sentence">Thus, in half of the blocks, the PM cue was defined by the response-relevant stimulus dimension of the ongoing task (i.e., subjects had to notice location PM cues while performing the location task or they had to notice arrow PM cues during the arrow task), and in the other half of the blocks, the PM cue was defined by the response-irrelevant dimension of the ongoing task (i.e., subjects had to notice arrow PM cues during the location task or location PM cues during the arrow task). </span><span class="sentence">We term this variable <i>PM-cue dimension</i>. </span><span class="sentence">Note that when PM cues were defined by the task-relevant stimulus dimension, the ongoing task involved three response alternatives, whereas when the PM cues were defined by the task-irrelevant dimension, the ongoing task involved four response alternatives.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Each block contained a total of 204 trials. </span><span class="sentence">Of these, 192 were <i>regular</i> trials, on which the arrow's direction and location were selected at random, with the constraint that the stimulus was not a PM cue. </span><span class="sentence">Twenty-five percent of the regular trials were spatially compatible trials (e.g., a left-pointing arrow appearing at the left location), and 75% were spatially incompatible trials (e.g., a left-pointing arrow appearing at the right location).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Each block also contained 6 <i>PM trials</i>, trials on which a PM cue appeared. </span><span class="sentence">PM trials were inserted at random positions with the constraint that these trials were separated by a minimum of 11 and a maximum of 66 intervening regular trials. </span><span class="sentence">Critically, 3 of the PM cues were instantiated by compatible stimuli (i.e., a downward-pointing arrow appearing below the fixation point), whereas the other 3 PM cues were instantiated by incompatible stimuli eliciting a response conflict (i.e., a downward-pointing arrow appearing at some location other than below the fixation point or an arrow appearing below the fixation point, but pointing in some direction other than downward).</span></p><p><span class="sentence">In addition, 6 trials with <i>deviant</i> stimuli (e.g., a cross instead of an arrow) appeared in each block. </span><span class="sentence">These trials were originally included to explore effects of rare deviants on reaction time (RT), but they are not related to the topic of this article and are not discussed further.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Note that the stimulus on approximately 25% of the incompatible regular trials was semantically related to the PM cue (i.e., a downward-pointing arrow at the top, right, or left location was semantically related to the PM cue when the PM cue was an arrow in the bottom location, and a leftward-, rightward-, or upward-pointing arrow at the bottom location was semantically related to the PM cue when the PM cue was a downward-pointing arrow). </span><span class="sentence">We term these trials <i>PM-related trials</i>. </span><span class="sentence">Although this was not our main focus, we investigated whether PM-related trials, because of their semantic relatedness to the actual PM cues, automatically captured attention and therefore incurred a performance cost in the ongoing task.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">To summarize, our task included compatible and incompatible regular trials (including incompatible PM-related trials) and compatible and incompatible PM trials (see <span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-figure1-j1467-9280200802042x">Fig. 1</span>).</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Design</h3></div><p><span class="sentence">The independent variables were (a) ongoing task (arrow direction vs. arrow location), (b) compatibility (compatible vs. incompatible), (c) trial type (regular vs. PM), and (d) PM cue dimension (response-relevant vs. response-irrelevant stimulus dimension for the ongoing task). </span><span class="sentence">Apart from ongoing task, all variables were varied within subjects.</span></p><div class="head-b"><h3>Predictions</h3></div><div class="head-c"><h4>Predictions for the Ongoing Task</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">For the ongoing task, we predicted that spatially incompatible stimuli would elicit a response conflict, which would be reflected in increased RTs and error rates relative to those on compatible trials. </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, because a pilot study indicated that the location task is the dominant task and produces generally faster RTs than the arrow task, we predicted a stronger compatibility effect in the (nondominant) arrow task than in the (dominant) location task. </span><span class="sentence">An ancillary prediction was that RTs in the ongoing task would be generally increased when the PM cues were defined by the task-irrelevant dimension, because in this case the ongoing task involved four responses, whereas it involved three responses when PM cues were defined by the task-relevant dimension.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Prediction for the PM Task</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">For the PM task, we predicted an interaction of compatibility and PM cue dimension. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, we expected that PM cues would be missed more often on incompatible than on compatible trials, and that this effect would be significantly stronger for PM cues defined by the task-irrelevant dimension than for PM cues defined by the task-relevant dimension. </span><span class="sentence">Note that such an interactive effect would be independent of any main effects of PM cue dimension. </span><span class="sentence">In particular, as the ongoing task comprised four responses when PM cues were defined by the task-irrelevant dimension but only three response alternatives when PM cues were defined by the task-relevant dimension, the ongoing task was presumably slightly more demanding in the former case, which might generally impair the detection of PM cues defined by the task-irrelevant dimension. </span><span class="sentence">However, this main effect would not affect the critical predicted interaction between PM cue dimension and compatibility.</span></p><div class="head-c"><h4>Prediction for PM-Related Stimuli</h4></div><p><span class="sentence">Finally, we predicted that PM-related stimuliâ€”because of their semantic relatedness to the PM cuesâ€”would capture attention and eventually trigger retrieval of the associated intention. </span><span class="sentence">This was expected to delay responses in the ongoing task (relative to incompatible regular trials on which the stimulus was unrelated to the PM cues) because of a time-consuming rechecking of whether or not the stimulus was actually a PM cue.</span></p>
