<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This experiment tests Predictions 1 and 2. </span><span class="sentence">The design involved orthogonal manipulations of the prevalence of each cause. </span><span class="sentence">Table 1 shows that the conditional contingency for each cause did not vary across the four conditions and that the conditional contingency for Cause A was always higher than that for Cause B. Values generated by Equation 1 for each cause in each condition are also shown in Table 1. </span><span class="sentence">The predicted values are higher for A and lower for B when the prevalence of A is high than when it is low. </span><span class="sentence">The predicted values are higher for B and lower for A when the prevalence of B is high than when it is low. </span><span class="sentence">This is the cause prevalence effect, Prediction 1. </span><span class="sentence">In the A low, B high condition, but not in any of the others, the predicted value for B is higher than that for A. The model therefore predicts that judgments of B should be higher than judgments of A in this condition alone. </span><span class="sentence">This is the test of Prediction 2.</span><br/><br/> <img

Mean Causal Judgments in Experiment 1</em></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Forty-one first-year undergraduate students of psychology participated in return for course credit.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimulus materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The materials were composed of a questionnaire with an initial written set of instructions followed by four judgmental tasks (shown in Table 1).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The instructions told participants to imagine that they were a horticulturalist studying a garden plant called <em>hosta</em>. </span><span class="sentence">Normally this plant had plain green leaves, but sometimes the leaves had an attractive gold edge much prized by gardeners. </span><span class="sentence">Their task was to find out what determines whether plants have gold edges on their leaves or not. </span><span class="sentence">The suspicion is that chemicals found in the soil might influence this, either causing or preventing gold edges. </span><span class="sentence">To test this, they set up a number of pots each containing one hosta, and they control whether the chemicals they are testing are present or absent in the pots. </span><span class="sentence">They investigate two chemicals at a time. </span><span class="sentence">Once the pots are set up, they wait to see if each plant's leaves have gold edges or not.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">On each page following, the participant would see the results of a series of trials involving a different kind of hosta and two chemicals, different ones on each page. </span><span class="sentence">At the top of the page the kind of hosta and the chemicals would be identified by code letters. </span><span class="sentence">Under this would be four columns of information. </span><span class="sentence">The first column identified individual plants by number. </span><span class="sentence">The second column identified one of the chemicals and told the participant whether that chemical was present or absent in the soil for each plant. </span><span class="sentence">The third column identified the other chemical and told the participant whether that chemical was present or absent in the soil for each plant. </span><span class="sentence">The fourth column indicated whether each plant developed gold edges on its leaves or not. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, by reading across a row, participants would see for each numbered plant whether the first chemical was present or absent, whether the second chemical was present or absent, and whether the plant developed gold edges on its leaves or not.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The instructions then told the participants that, at the bottom of each page, they would see the following two questions:</p><blockquote>To what extent does [the first chemical] cause or prevent gold edges on the leaves?To what extent does [the second chemical] cause or prevent gold edges on the leaves?</blockquote><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">To make their judgment, they were to write a number from −100 to +100 beside each question. </span><span class="sentence">Writing −100 meant that the chemical in question very strongly prevents gold edges on the leaves. </span><span class="sentence">Writing zero meant that the chemical in question has no effect either way. </span><span class="sentence">Writing +100 meant that the chemical in question very strongly causes gold edges on the leaves. </span><span class="sentence">The more strongly they thought the chemical in question prevented gold edges on the leaves, the lower the number they should put. </span><span class="sentence">The more strongly they thought the chemical in question caused gold edges on the leaves, the higher the number they should put.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Each page of the questionnaire presented a separate judgmental task (hereafter <em>task</em>) conforming to this format but with different identifiers for hosta species and chemicals. </span><span class="sentence">There were four tasks in all. </span><span class="sentence">The first chemical, that is, the one information about which was in the second column, is here designated Cause A, and the second chemical, information about which was in the third column, is Cause B.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Two variables were manipulated within subjects. </span><span class="sentence">The prevalence of Cause B (B prevalence) was manipulated with two values, low and high. </span><span class="sentence">As shown in Table 1, in the low condition there were 3 B + instances and 1 B− instance. </span><span class="sentence">In the high condition there were 12 B+ and 4 B− instances. </span><span class="sentence">The other independent variable was the prevalence of Cause A (A prevalence), which was also manipulated with two values, low and high. </span><span class="sentence">As shown in Table 1, in the low condition there were 4 A+ instances and 1 A− instance, and in the high condition there were 12 A+ and 3 A− instances. </span><span class="sentence">Table 1 shows that both kinds of conditional contingency are constant across conditions for both causes and that the conditional contingency for Cause A is in all conditions higher than the corresponding kind of conditional contingency for B.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The nature of these manipulations entailed that the total number of instances per judgmental task varied from 17 to 39. </span><span class="sentence">Instances were randomly ordered within tasks, and order of tasks was randomized independently for each participant.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants were tested individually in a small office. </span><span class="sentence">The questionnaire for this experiment was included among a set of materials for experiments on unrelated topics. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told that they should ask questions if anything in the instructions was not clear. </span><span class="sentence">None had any questions about the materials for this experiment. </span><span class="sentence">Participants then proceeded through the tasks at their own pace. </span><span class="sentence">At the end of the session participants were given course credit and debriefed about the general aims of the research but not about the specific hypothesis being tested.</span></p>
