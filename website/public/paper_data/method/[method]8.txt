class="sentence">A total of 192 undergraduate students from the Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France, participated in the experiment in partial fulfillment of a course requirement. </span><span class="sentence">All participants were native French speakers. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four Dependency Type × Digit Combination experimental groups (<em>n</em> = 48 for each group).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Materials</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The stimuli used in the study phase consisted of 20 problems composed of a target digit inside a rectangle on the left (which indicated the value of the target for this problem) and a sequence of 20 digits on the right (see Figure 1). </span><span class="sentence">In every sequence, (a) each of the 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) occurred twice, (b) a pair of digits forming an adjacent dependency (e.g., <em>64</em>) occurred twice, and (c) a pair of digits forming a nonadjacent dependency (e.g., <em>3X7</em>) occurred twice. </span><span class="sentence">The adjacent and nonadjacent pairs were identical for all of the problems presented to a given participant. </span><span class="sentence">For each problem, the target digit was selected randomly among the digits 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9, that is, those digits that were not elements of the pairs forming the adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies. </span><span class="sentence">When the task involved a subtraction between adjacent digits, the target digit occurred once just before one of the two pairs of digits forming an adjacent dependency and once in another position. </span><span class="sentence">When the task involved a subtraction between nonadjacent digits, the target digit occurred once between the two pairs of digits forming a nonadjacent dependency and once in another position. </span><span class="sentence">Figure 1a shows three problems with the adjacent pair <em>64</em>, and with the nonadjacent pair <em>3X7</em>, when the task consisted in deciding whether the difference between the two digits following the target digit equals three (this is the case for the second problem in which the digits 8 and 5 follow the target 1). </span><span class="sentence">Figure 1b shows three problems with the adjacent pair <em>64</em>, and with the nonadjacent pair <em>3X7</em>, when the task consists in deciding whether the difference between the

of the two pairs forming the adjacent dependency, the position of the two pairs forming the nonadjacent dependency, and the position of the residual digits were determined randomly. </span><span

class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment was carried out with groups of 15 to 20 participants. </span><span class="sentence">In the study phase, the participants were provided with the sheet of paper containing the 20 problems. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were asked to look for the target digit within each sequence of 20 digits while going through the sequence from left to right. </span><span class="sentence">They were informed that the target digit could occur more than once within a sequence. </span><span

two digits surrounding the target digit equaled 3, a task that entails the processing of two nonadjacent digits. </span><span class="sentence">The two groups had to circle the target and the two

data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">After this task, the sheets of paper used in the study phase were withdrawn and replaced by those for the recognition test. </span><span class="sentence">All of the participants, regardless of the group to which they were assigned, were asked to select which of two strings of three digits was part of the digit sequences viewed in the study phase of the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were told that they had to make a choice for each of the 16 pairs, even if they sometimes felt that they were guessing.</span></p>
