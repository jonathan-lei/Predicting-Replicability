<h3>Method</h3><br/> <h4>Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Twenty-four adults from the Université Laval, Québec City, Québec, Canada, took part in the experiment in exchange for a small honorarium. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal audition and vision.</p> <h4>Material</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The ISR task was programmed with Microsoft Visual Basic (Version 6.0). At each trial, nine letters were played to the participant through headphones at a rate of one letter per second (700 ms On, 300 ms Off) at approximately 65 dB(A). The items were recorded in a French female voice and edited with Sound Forge (Version 7.0; Sony Corporation, 2003). The same set of monosyllabic letters was used over trials (<em>D</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>G</em>, <em>H</em>, <em>K</em>, <em>L</em>, <em>N</em>, <em>Q</em>, and <em>R</em>); only the order of presentation changed from trial to trial. After each sequence, the nine letters were randomly presented horizontally within a 17- × 17-cm frame on a computer screen, and participants had to give their <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> by using a mouse to click on the letters. Each letter changed from black to green when selected and remained that way until the end of the trial.</p> <h4>Design and Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The sequence heard on Trial 4 was presented 12 times during the experiment, once every four trials. There were three novel randomly generated sequences between each <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> of the critical sequence, forming 12 blocks of four trials. Two practice trials preceded the 48 <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trials (12 repeated sequences and 36 novel sequences). The critical repeated sequence was randomly chosen for each participant. Participants were told to memorize all the items they heard in the same order in which they were presented and to try to reproduce the <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> sequence in the recall phase. Participants received no feedback on their <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong>. No other instructions were given and, of course, no cues about the repeating sequences were provided. Participants were tested individually.</p> <h3>Results and Discussion</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To study the classical <strong data-auto="strong_text">Hebb</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong>, the proportion of <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> for repeated and novel sequences was calculated for each of the 12 <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> blocks. All items recalled in their <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> serial position were considered <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong>. We calculated slopes for the proportion of <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> across for repeated and nonrepeated sequences (separately for each participant and then averaged over all 24 participants). Two average <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> slopes are compared. One slope represents the change in proportion of <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> on Presentations 1 to 12 of the repeated sequence. The second slope corresponds to the change in proportion of <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> for the 12 corresponding blocks of three nonrepeated trials. We observed a <strong data-auto="strong_text">Hebb</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong>, that is, a sequence <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> beyond mere task practice. Indeed, the averaged <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> slope for the repeated series was 0.15 <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> items per <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> and 0.05 <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> items for the novel trials. This difference was significant, <em>t</em>(23) = 1.99, <em>p</em> = .05, <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> size <em>d</em> = 0.83.</p> <h4>New <strong data-auto="strong_text">Errors</strong> Versus Repeated <strong data-auto="strong_text">Errors</strong></h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong data-auto="strong_text">Responses</strong> not recalled in their proper serial positions were classified as erroneous <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong>. The error analysis was restricted to the 11 last-repeated trials (<strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> on the first presentation of the critical list are necessarily new). If a given error was previously made in the same serial position on any preceding repeated sequence, it was counted as a repeated error. Otherwise, the error counted as a new error. Figure 1 shows the number of <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> made by participants for the repeated series in the verbal ISR task. On this diagram, <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> are decomposed into new and repeated <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong>. Repeated <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> were further decomposed into repetitions from the last repeated sequence (<em>n</em> − 1) or repetitions from an earlier sequence (<em>n</em> − 2+). Estes (1991) showed that protrusions from the sequence that immediately precedes a list are a key source of error. Figure 1 suggests that protrusions may also originate from preceding <em>repeated sequences</em> when using a <strong data-auto="strong_text">Hebb</strong> paradigm (interspaced by filler lists). These two types of protrusions are conceptually distinct and complementary. Only protrusions from the repeated sequences are considered in the present study to test whether these <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> are subject to a form of <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> that mirrors the classical <strong data-auto="strong_text">Hebb</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong>.<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/a065804c828c9876d5f9c38f09c4b7f4/5ebcb18c/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-3-524-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-3-524-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

Diagram screening types of <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> made to the 11 repetitions of the recurring sequence. Totals are calculated for all participants combined.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When one uses the <strong data-auto="strong_text">Hebb</strong> procedure, two forms of <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> may occur across the repeated sequences: One is characterized by an increasing proportion of <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong>, and one is characterized by an increasing proportion of repeated <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong>. The former corresponds to the classical <strong data-auto="strong_text">Hebb</strong> sequence <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong>, whereas the latter suggests that <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> can also take place for erroneous <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong>. However, one has to consider that simply repeating <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> does not necessarily indicate that they are learned. Indeed, fixed error probabilities (with no <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> across repetitions) can also explain why <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> are repeated. Repeated <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> can be shown to increase simply due to chance, given constant error probabilities. <sup/> This increase in recurring <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> across the 12 <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> blocks is attributable to the fact that each new error necessarily increases the probability for subsequent <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> to be classified as <em>repeated</em> rather than <em>new</em>. Therefore, a simple error <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> analysis does not adequately answer the question of interest.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> are progressively learned across repetitions of the critical sequence as typically observed for <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong>, then they should become more probable as a function of the number of times that they have been produced in previous identical sequences. On the basis of this reasoning, we developed a measure that can reveal two sides of Hebbian <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong>. Indeed this measure applies both to <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong>. The measure and analysis are proved valid by simulation (i.e., that they do not falsely indicate error <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> when there is none).</p> <h4>A Measure of Response <strong data-auto="strong_text">Learning</strong> Across Repeated Sequences</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We hypothesize that if <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> takes place on the basis of <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> made (<strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> or incorrect), then the probability of producing a given response should increase as a function of the number of times the same response had previously been recalled (referred to as the number of past occurrences). The number of past occurrences indicates the specific number of times that a response is produced at the same serial position in preceding presentations of the repeated sequence. The key difference between error <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> across repeated sequences and error repetitions due to constant transposition probabilities is that the latter does not predict an increase in error probabilities across the number of past occurrences. Conversely, if a response (<strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> or incorrect) is repeated without being learned—as tested in a simulation reported below—its observed probability should be invariable across those repetitions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Probabilities were calculated for the nine <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> (one for each serial position) and for 16 transposition <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> involving the most common <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> in ISR, that is, Serial Position <em>p</em> − 1 or <em>p</em> + 1 transpositions. Each of the nine serial positions was associated with two types of transpositions, <em>p</em> − 1 or <em>p</em> + 1, except for the first and the final serial positions for which only one transposition can occur, <em>p</em> + 1 for the first serial position or <em>p</em> − 1 for the final one. The transpositions considered in the current analysis were as follows: <em>T</em>1 + 1, <em>T</em>2 − 1, <em>T</em>2 + 1, <em>T</em>3 − 1, <em>T</em>3 + 1, <em>T</em>4 − 1, <em>T</em>4 + 1, <em>T</em>5 − 1, <em>T</em>5 + 1, <em>T</em>6 − 1, <em>T</em>6 + 1, <em>T</em>7 − 1, <em>T</em>7 + 1, <em>T</em>8 − 1, <em>T</em>8 + 1, <em>T</em>9 − 1. For instance, a <em>T</em>2 + 1 transposition involves an incorrect item recalled on Serial Position 2 that should have been recalled on Serial Position 3. It is worth noting that <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> studied here are perhaps those that are the most likely to be learned. Other transpositions (of Serial Position <em>p</em> + 3 or <em>p</em> − 3, for example) may show a weaker <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> (or interfere less with the production of a <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong>, probabilities were computed separately for each serial position. Thus, data from <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> with different probabilities were not aggregated. The analysis involves sorting <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> according to the number of occurrences of that response in the preceding trials of the repeated sequence. Each time a response is recalled by a participant (at the relevant serial position), it counts as an occurrence of that response for a specific <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> (<strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 1, <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 2, and so on). For each <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong>, probabilities are calculated by counting the number of occurrences of a response and dividing it by the number of opportunities. Response opportunities correspond to the number of presentations of the repeated sequence (those associated with a same number of past occurrences) in which the response was produced or could have been produced. The occurrences and opportunities for each number of past occurrences are pooled across participants before the probability of each response is computed. Table 1 shows the <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> of a sample participant for the 12 repetitions of the critical sequence. These data will be used as an example to show exactly how response probabilities are calculated for each <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong>.<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/237835efc90a604d070e3a74dcac3523/5ebcb18c/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-3-524-tbl1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-3-524-tbl1a.gif" title="Responses Produced by a Sample Participant for the 12 Repeated Sequences and Identification of the Number of Past Occurrences for Correct Response Q at Position 3 and Transposition Error K at Position 8"/><em><strong data-auto="strong_text">Responses</strong> Produced by a Sample Participant for the 12 Repeated Sequences and Identification of the Number of Past Occurrences for <strong data-auto="strong_text">Correct</strong> Response Q at Position 3 and Transposition Error K at Position 8</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The present analysis requires calculating the probability of a response for each <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> of that response. For each cell in Table 1, the number of past occurrences can be obtained by counting the number of previous occurrences of the target response in the cells above it in the same column. Table 1 shows two examples of this procedure, one for a <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response (Q at Position 3) and the other for a transposition error (K at Position 8). These examples (described below) were chosen randomly from our sample of participants for illustrative purposes.</p> <h4>Example 1</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The first example shows how to calculate the probability of producing the <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response “Q” at Serial Position 3 as a function of the number of previous occurrences of that response. At the first presentation of the list, the number of prior occurrences of that Response Q is 0 (see Column Q in Table 1). In this example, the number of prior occurrences becomes 1 at the second presentation of the repeated sequence because there is now 1 occurrence of Response Q above that cell. This value does not change at the third presentation because there is still only 1 prior occurrence of Response “Q” (the occurrence of “Q” at the third presentation does not count as a prior occurrence). The number of prior occurrences becomes 2 at the fourth presentation, 3 at the seventh presentation, 4 at the eighth presentation, and so on. The number of occurrences and opportunities of a response are calculated for Repetitions 1 to 4. There is 1 occurrence of Response Q among the two cells that have 1 prior occurrence of that response (those at the second and third presentations of the repeated sequence; see Column Q in Table 1). For that participant, we count 1 occurrence and 2 opportunities for producing that response at <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 1. For <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 2, there were 3 opportunities (the fourth, fifth, and sixth presentations) and again only 1 occurrence. Hence, for <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 1 the probability of producing the <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response is 1/2. For <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 2, the probability is 1/3. Using the same logic, for <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 3 the probability is 1/1, and for <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 4, the observed probability is 1/1. The number of occurrences is always either 0 or 1 when based on individual participant data (after a single occurrence, if there is one, the number of prior occurrences necessarily increases). To obtain group trends, occurrences and opportunities are pooled across participants for each number of prior occurrences. For example, across all participants, the probability of producing the <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response at Serial Position 3 when there is 1 prior occurrence (<strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 1) is obtained by dividing the total of 24 occurrences by the total of 51 opportunities, giving a probability of .47. For <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 4, the total across participants is 21 occurrences on 26 opportunities, giving a probability of .81. This means that when this item has been recalled four times in previous repeated lists, the observed probability of recalling it again on the next repeated list is .81. For the present analysis, we only estimated the probabilities for Repetitions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The trend for each response was then approximated with a slope.</p> <h4>Example 2</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The same procedure was used for each of the 16 <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> selected for the present analysis (<em>p</em> − 1 or <em>p</em> + 1 transpositions). Example 2 shows how to calculate the probability of producing the error “K” at Serial Position 8 (Transposition <em>T</em>8 − 1) as a function of the number of previous occurrences of that response. In Table 1 (Column F), the number of prior occurrences displayed corresponds to the error K, not to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response. The number of prior occurrences in each cell is calculated by counting the number of Ks in the cells above it (i.e., in the previous presentations of the repeated sequence). The error K occurred once when the number of prior occurrences was 1 (<strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 1) and there was only 1 opportunity. For <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 2, there was 1 occurrence on 4 opportunities. <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 3 has 1 occurrence of Error K and 3 opportunities. For <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 4, there was 1 occurrence and 1 opportunity. To estimate response probabilities for each <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong>, we divided the total number of occurrences on the total number of opportunities when combined for all 24 participants. For example, transposition <em>T</em>8 − 1 was actually produced 8 times out of 29 occasions for <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 2, when calculated over all participants (note that if all 24 participants had repeated that error twice, the total number of occurrences would have been 24). The estimated probability of transposition <em>T</em>8 − 1 for <strong data-auto="strong_text">Repetition</strong> 2 was .28.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The probabilities for each <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response and transposition, as a function of the number of past occurrences, are listed in Table 2 and Table 3.

For the error <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> analysis, the simulation data can be viewed as a control group. The simulation also assumes that <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> relates specifically to the production of <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong>. It attempts to replicate the <strong data-auto="strong_text">Hebb</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> by relying exclusively on a (<strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong>) response-<strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> mechanism. The basic probabilities used to generate <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> (transpositions) are shown in Table 4. These probabilities were chosen arbitrarily for the purposes of (a) recreating a typical serial position <strong data-auto="strong_text">effect</strong> and (b) reproducing a typical trend in error distributions where transposition probabilities diminish with the number of serial positions between the error and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response. To simulate <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong>, a new set of probabilities was derived for each <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong> of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response. At each <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong>, its probability of being recalled was increased by 9% (which corresponds to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> slope for <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> in the experiment). The chance of recalling the other possible <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong> was reduced by that same percentage (this reduction was distributed evenly across <strong data-auto="strong_text">responses</strong>). No additional parameters or assumptions were necessary for the simulation. The simulation generated data for 200 fictitious participants. Each simulated participant performed 12 repeated sequences (there was no point in simulating the filler lists because they were not part of the analysis). Individual differences were entirely due to random sampling, as the data were generated with the same underlying probabilities (those in Table 4). Error repetitions throughout the 12 trials were necessarily due to chance (not to error <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong>). This simulation thus embodies the null hypothesis that no error <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> occurs but that <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> are nevertheless repeated due to the usual pattern of transpositions. The simulated data can then be analyzed in exactly the same way as the empirical data. If the <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> measure is sound, then response probabilities for the simulated <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong> should not increase as a function of the number of prior occurrences of these <strong data-auto="strong_text">errors</strong>. However, the same measure should indicate that <strong data-auto="strong_text">correct</strong> response probabilities increased across Repetitions 1 to 4, at a similar rate to that observed in the experiment (increasing by 9% at each <strong data-auto="strong_text">repetition</strong>).<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/bca57c9c5f9444cd0a31166626e91cfc/5ebcb18c/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-3-524-tbl4a.gif" alt="xlm-34-3-524-tbl4a.gif" title="Simulated Probabilities of Recalling the Correct Item (Diagonal) and Error Probabilities as a Function of Serial Position"/><em>Simulated Probabilities of Recalling the <strong data-auto="strong_text">Correct</strong> Item (Diagonal) and Error Probabilities as a Function of Serial Position</em></p>
