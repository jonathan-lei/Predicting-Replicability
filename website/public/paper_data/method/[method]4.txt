<h3>Method</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We tested our hypothesis by having participants undergo a series of <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong>-practice and <strong data-auto="strong_text">relearning</strong> cycles that were designed to induce and eliminate the effects of <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">induced</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">forgetting</strong> repeatedly.</p> <h4>Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A total of 240 undergraduate students from the University of California, Los Angeles (73 men and 167 women) averaging 20.7 years of age participated in the experiment.</p> <h4>Materials</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Eight categories, each containing six exemplars of high taxonomic strength, no two of which began with the same first letter, were used in the present study. The eight <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> categories were first divided into two separate sets of four so that—for any individual participant—half of the categories received <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice, and the other half did not. The two subsets were further divided into two sets of two such that half of the categories receiving <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice and half of the categories not receiving <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice were either relearned or not relearned. Thus, for any 1 participant, there were two practiced categories that were relearned and two practiced categories that were not relearned and, also, two unpracticed categories that were relearned and two unpracticed categories that were not relearned.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">During <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice, participants were shown a series of category names and two-letter stems that began associated exemplars of relatively low taxonomic frequency. The targets of this <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice were always extralist items—that is, items that were not presented during the study phase of the experiment. Although this procedure differs from the typical <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong>-practice paradigm—as Bauml (2002) and Storm, Bjork, Bjork, and Nestojko (2006) have demonstrated—<strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">induced</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">forgetting</strong> is also obtained when participants generate extralist exemplars during <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice. Thus, for a given subject, all six exemplars of a given category presented during the study phase served either as Rp– items or as Nrp items. The experiment was counterbalanced such that studied exemplars were associated with every <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> condition equally often across participants.</p> <h4>Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment was conducted in three main phases: study, <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice/<strong data-auto="strong_text">relearning</strong>, and test.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Study phase</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Forty-eight category–exemplar pairs were presented via computer at a rate of one pair per second.

Although the same cues were provided during the <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong>-practice blocks, and the same items were relearned in subsequent <strong data-auto="strong_text">relearning</strong> blocks, the order of their presentation was different in each block.<br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/6cc9933d98dba653c56b2e8f11cffe80/5ebcaef5/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-1-230-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-230-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.
