<h3>Method</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We tested our hypothesis by having participants undergo a series of retrieval-practice and relearning cycles that were designed to induce and eliminate the effects of retrieval-induced forgetting repeatedly.</span></p> <h4>Participants</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">A total of 240 undergraduate students from the University of California, Los Angeles (73 men and 167 women) averaging 20.7 years of age participated in the experiment.</span></p> <h4>Materials</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Eight categories, each containing six exemplars of high taxonomic strength, no two of which began with the same first letter, were used in the present study. </span><span class="sentence">The eight experimental categories were first divided into two separate sets of four so that—for any individual participant—half of the categories received retrieval practice, and the other half did not. </span><span class="sentence">The two subsets were further divided into two sets of two such that half of the categories receiving retrieval practice and half of the categories not receiving retrieval practice were either relearned or not relearned. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, for any 1 participant, there were two practiced categories that were relearned and two practiced categories that were not relearned and, also, two unpracticed categories that were relearned and two unpracticed categories that were not relearned.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">During retrieval practice, participants were shown a series of category names and two-letter stems that began associated exemplars of relatively low taxonomic frequency. </span><span class="sentence">The targets of this retrieval practice were always extralist items—that is, items that were not presented during the study phase of the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">Although this procedure differs from the typical retrieval-practice paradigm—as Bauml (2002) and Storm, Bjork, Bjork, and Nestojko (2006) have demonstrated—retrieval-induced forgetting is also obtained when participants generate extralist exemplars during retrieval practice. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, for a given subject, all six exemplars of a given category presented during the study phase served either as Rp– items or as Nrp items. </span><span class="sentence">The experiment was counterbalanced such that studied exemplars were associated with every experimental condition equally often across participants.</span></p> <h4>Procedure</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment was conducted in three main phases: study, retrieval practice/relearning, and test.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Study phase</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Forty-eight category–exemplar pairs were presented via computer at a rate of one pair per second. </span><span class="sentence">The presentation order was set randomly with the constraint that no two consecutive pairs were from the same category.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Retrieval-practice/relearning phase</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The retrieval-practice/relearning phase immediately followed the study phase. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following five conditions, which are shown in schematic form in Figure 1: (a) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice; (b) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice, followed by one block of relearning; (c) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice, followed by one block of relearning, and then a second block of retrieval practice; (d) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice, followed by one block of relearning, a second block of retrieval practice, and then a second block of relearning; (e) participants receiving one block of retrieval practice, followed by one block of relearning, a second block of retrieval practice, a second block of relearning, and then a third block of retrieval practice. </span><span class="sentence">Although the same cues were provided during the retrieval-practice blocks, and the same items were relearned in subsequent relearning blocks, the order of their presentation was different in each block.</span><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/xlm-34-1-230-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-230-fig1a.gif"/><em>Figure 1.
