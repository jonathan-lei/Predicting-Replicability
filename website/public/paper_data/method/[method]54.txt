<h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were seventy-five undergraduates (62 women and 13 men) who participated for partial course credit. They ranged in age from 17–21 years (<em>M</em> = 18.46, <em>SD</em> = 0.72). Ethnic groups included 72% White, 17% African American, 2.5% Asian, 7% Hispanic, and 1.5% Native American.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were seated at a computer and asked to complete several measures. Of interest were indirect AMP evaluations, direct AMP evaluations, and racial-<strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> questionnaires. Indirect and direct evaluations were completed in a counterbalanced order, followed by the questionnaires. Participants next provided demographic information and were debriefed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>AMP</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Indirect evaluations</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For the indirect rating trials, participants were presented with one of three kinds of primes: a Black face, a White face, or a gray square that served as a neutral prime. The face primes were 12 Black men and 12 White men. The pictures showed only the model's face, with a neutral facial expression. Based on pilot testing, the Black and White photos were matched on attractiveness and were selected to be highly prototypical of their respective racial category.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The prime appeared in the center of the screen for 100 ms, followed by a blank screen for 100 ms and then a Chinese pictograph for 100 ms (see Figure 1). Following the pictograph, a patterned mask of black and white “noise” appeared. At the bottom of the screen was a 4-point rating scale that included −2 (<em>very unpleasant</em>), −1 (<em>slightly unpleasant</em>), +1 (<em>slightly pleasant</em>), and + 2 (<em>very pleasant</em>). After participants provided their evaluation of the pictograph, the next trial began. A total of 72 randomly ordered trials were presented, with 24 neutral, 24 Black, and 24 White primes paired with 72 unique Chinese pictographs. For each participant, the computer paired a pictograph with a prime in a new random order.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were told that the task was about making judgments while avoiding distraction. They were instructed to rate the pleasantness of the Chinese pictographs using the rating scale. Participants were warned to not let their rating of the pictographs be influenced by the preceding photo. This warning was included to ensure that AMP responses represented the effect of the prime, despite participants' attempts at correction, thereby serving as an indication of the automatic influence of prime-invoked <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitudes</strong> (Payne, Cheng, et al., 2005). The instructions read as follows:

<blockquote>For this round of judgments you should <b><i>rate the Chinese characters</i></b>. Please note that sometimes the photos flashed prior to the characters can influence people's ratings of the Chinese characters. Please try your best not to be influenced by the photographs. Instead, <b><i>please give us an honest judgment of how pleasant or unpleasant is your reaction to each Chinese character</i></b>. Of course, there are no right or wrong answers. Just report your “gut reaction.” [Emphasis was in the original.]</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Direct evaluations</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The direct rating procedure was identical to the indirect rating procedure with three exceptions. The first and most important difference was that participants were instructed to rate their evaluations of the prime photographs and to avoid being influenced by the Chinese pictographs. Because the pictographs were ambiguous and randomly paired with the primes, they could not actually exert any systematic influence on ratings of the primes. The instructions read as follows:

<blockquote>For this round of judgments you should <b>rate the photos of people</b>. Please note that sometimes the Chinese characters flashed after the photos can influence people's ratings of the photos. Please try your best not to be influenced by the characters. Instead, <b>please give us an honest judgment of how pleasant or unpleasant is your reaction to each person's photo</b>. Of course, there are no right or wrong answers. Just report your “gut reaction.”</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second difference was that no neutral primes were included, because direct evaluations of a gray square would be uninformative. The third difference was that only 24 trials were included, one trial for each unique prime photo. In the direct rating blocks, each prime photo was rated only once for the same reason that each item is only presented once on questionnaires. Because participants were directly expressing their <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitudes</strong> toward the <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitude</strong> objects, there was little need for repetitive judgments of the same items.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Self-Report <strong data-auto="strong_text">Attitude</strong> Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Two self-report measures of racial <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitudes</strong> were used: the MRS (McConahay, 1983) and the ATB (Brigham, 1993). The MRS is a 7-item assessment of anti-Black <strong data-auto="strong_text">attitudes</strong> and includes items such as “Over the past few years, the government and news media have shown more respect to blacks then they deserve.” Responses were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 9 (<em>strongly agree</em>). The ATB is a 20-item assessment that includes items such as “Black and White people are inherently equal” and “It is likely that Blacks will bring violence to neighborhoods when they move in.” Responses were made on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 9 (<em>strongly agree</em>).</p>
