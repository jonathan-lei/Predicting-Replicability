<h3>Study 7: Could a Subtle Empathy–Capability Manipulation Reduce Men's Vengefulness?</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Study 7 built on the gender interaction findings from Studies 4–6. </span><span class="sentence">The personal capability manipulations from those studies represented overt, conscious primes. </span><span class="sentence">In Study 7, we examined whether a more subtle manipulation could be effective. </span><span class="sentence">Rather than going through the conscious step of writing about one's own offense or envisioning the other person's perspective, could it be useful to simply answer questions involving personal capability and empathic understanding? We predicted that it would.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We saw an opportunity to test this hypothesis in an existing data set. </span><span class="sentence">As in Study 6, this study used real-life offenses, but it also included counterbalancing of questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence">The study included questions about personal capability and empathic understanding. </span><span class="sentence">The survey was structured so that some participants answered the capability and empathy questions just before they completed the vengefulness measure, whereas others did not answer them until after the vengefulness measure. </span><span class="sentence">Our purpose in Study 7 was to see whether simply being asked to reflect on these questions would be enough to reduce vengefulness scores—at least for men.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Participants (83 men, 72 women) were taking an introductory psychology course at a private research university in Ohio. </span><span class="sentence">They completed a survey for course credit. </span><span class="sentence">Ethnicities were primarily Caucasian (79%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (16%). </span><span class="sentence">The mean age was 18.9 (<em>SD</em> = 1.3).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">As in Studies 2 and 6, participants recalled an offense that was committed against them. </span><span class="sentence">On the basis of counterbalancing procedures,  some participants completed the capability–empathy questions before the vengefulness questions, whereas others completed them afterward.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Unforgiveness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">We again used the TRIM-18-R (McCullough &amp; Hoyt, 2002; whole TRIM, <em>M</em> = 2.7, <em>SD</em> = 0.9, α = .85; Vengefulness, <em>M</em> = 2.0, <em>SD</em> = 1.0, α = .90; Avoidance, <em>M</em> = 3.0, <em>SD</em> = 1.1; α = .92; Benevolence, <em>M</em> = 3.0, <em>SD</em> = 1.0, α = .91).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Personal capability and empathy</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The page assessing personal capability and empathy (which was used as the experimental manipulation here) contained three measures, the first two of which were counterbalanced. </span><span class="sentence">The four items from Study 2 assessed personal capability for committing an offense similar in severity (<em>M</em> = 4.7, <em>SD</em> = 3.1, α = .95). </span><span class="sentence">Another set of personal capability questions was modified to emphasize similarity in offense type rather than severity (e.g., “Given the right circumstances, could you be capable of doing something similar in <em>type</em> to what the other person did?”; <em>M</em> = 4.6, <em>SD</em> = 3.1, α = .94). </span><span class="sentence">The two sets of capability questions were highly correlated, <em>r</em>(155) = .66, <em>p</em> &lt; .01, and were thus combined into a single measure (<em>M</em> = 4.7, <em>SD</em> = 2.8). </span><span class="sentence">After the personal capability questions, the page included the four empathic understanding items from Study 2 (<em>M</em> = 3.8, <em>SD</em> = 2.6, α = .89).</span></p>
