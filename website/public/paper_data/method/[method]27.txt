<h3>Study 7: Could a Subtle Empathy–Capability Manipulation Reduce Men's Vengefulness?</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 7 built on the gender interaction findings from Studies 4–6. The personal capability manipulations from those studies represented overt, conscious primes. In Study 7, we examined whether a more subtle manipulation could be effective. Rather than going through the conscious step of writing about one's own offense or envisioning the other person's perspective, could it be useful to simply answer questions involving personal capability and empathic understanding? We predicted that it would.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We saw an opportunity to test this hypothesis in an existing data set. As in Study 6, this study used real-life offenses, but it also included counterbalancing of questionnaires. The study included questions about personal capability and empathic understanding. The survey was structured so that some participants answered the capability and empathy questions just before they completed the vengefulness measure, whereas others did not answer them until after the vengefulness measure. Our purpose in Study 7 was to see whether simply being asked to reflect on these questions would be enough to reduce vengefulness scores—at least for men.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants (83 men, 72 women) were taking an introductory <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> course at a private research university in Ohio. They completed a survey for course credit. Ethnicities were primarily Caucasian (79%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (16%). The mean age was 18.9 (<em>SD</em> = 1.3).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As in Studies 2 and 6, participants recalled an offense that was committed against them. On the basis of counterbalancing procedures, <sup/> some participants completed the capability–empathy questions before the vengefulness questions, whereas others completed them afterward.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Unforgiveness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We again used the TRIM-18-R (McCullough &amp; Hoyt, 2002; whole TRIM, <em>M</em> = 2.7, <em>SD</em> = 0.9, α = .85; Vengefulness, <em>M</em> = 2.0, <em>SD</em> = 1.0, α = .90; Avoidance, <em>M</em> = 3.0, <em>SD</em> = 1.1; α = .92; Benevolence, <em>M</em> = 3.0, <em>SD</em> = 1.0, α = .91).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Personal capability and empathy</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The page assessing personal capability and empathy (which was used as the experimental manipulation here) contained three measures, the first two of which were counterbalanced. The four items from Study 2 assessed personal capability for committing an offense similar in severity (<em>M</em> = 4.7, <em>SD</em> = 3.1, α = .95). Another set of personal capability questions was modified to emphasize similarity in offense type rather than severity (e.g., “Given the right circumstances, could you be capable of doing something similar in <em>type</em> to what the other person did?”; <em>M</em> = 4.6, <em>SD</em> = 3.1, α = .94). The two sets of capability questions were highly correlated, <em>r</em>(155) = .66, <em>p</em> &lt; .01, and were thus combined into a single measure (<em>M</em> = 4.7, <em>SD</em> = 2.8). After the personal capability questions, the page included the four empathic understanding items from Study 2 (<em>M</em> = 3.8, <em>SD</em> = 2.6, α = .89).</p>
