<h3>Experiment 3</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that illusory recollections about the origin of a statement can be created by providing stereotype information at retrieval that draws on well-learned semantic categories about doctors and lawyers.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">There are a variety of different explanations for the occurrence of illusory recollections. </span><span class="sentence">In other paradigms, misattribution of strong familiarity is a plausible explanation for illusory recollections (i.e., false remember responses). </span><span class="sentence">For instance, in the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm, participants tend to give high rates of remember responses to new words (e.g., <em>sleep</em>) that appear familiar because they are semantically related to what was studied (e.g., <em>tired, dream, pillow, rest</em>; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995). </span><span class="sentence">More recently, Chan and McDermott (2006) observed a similar effect when participants make pragmatic inference errors. </span><span class="sentence">For instance, after hearing that a “flimsy shelf weakened under the weight of the books,” participants later often incorrectly recognize that they had heard the word <em>broke</em> and give high levels of remember responses to this false recognition. </span><span class="sentence">Drawing on the signal detection account of Wixted and Stretch (2004; see also Donaldson, 1996), Chan and McDermott suggested that the high rates of false remember responses may be due to the misattribution of strong familiarity. </span><span class="sentence">According to Wixted and Stretch (2004), participants make remember and know responses on the basis of a single dimension of memory strength, which is based on the overall amount of information that is provided by separate remember and familiarity processes. </span><span class="sentence">Consequently, a remember response can be due to the presence of (a) a large amount of remember information and little familiarity information, (b) a large amount of familiarity information and little remember information, or (c) a large amount of both kinds of information. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, from this point of view, in both the DRM and pragmatic-inference paradigms, the strong familiarity that is associated with the semantically related lure items on the test may account for erroneous remember responses.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">This misattribution of strong familiarity account, however, cannot easily explain the false remember responses in the present paradigm. </span><span class="sentence">In contrast to the foregoing paradigms in which participants incorrectly endorse new words as old, in our paradigm participants must attribute items that are already recognized as old to one source or the other and give a remember or know response as a basis for this source attribution. </span><span class="sentence">To explain the high levels of false remember responses to erroneous source attributions, the misattribution of familiarity account must predict that items are more familiar when participants respond in a schema-consistent manner than when they respond in a schema-inconsistent manner (e.g., higher familiarity when incorrectly providing a doctor response to the doctor-related items than when incorrectly providing a doctor response to the lawyer-related items). </span><span class="sentence">There was no support for this prediction. </span><span class="sentence">If there had been differences in familiarity between the items, then this would have produced differences in item recognition. </span><span class="sentence">However, recognition rates—as measured by the <em>D</em> parameter, which is equivalent to a corrected recognition score—were no different for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items when they were presented by either a mismatching or matching source. </span><span class="sentence">Yet, despite the absence of these memory differences, there were strong differences in the pattern of illusory recollections. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, there is no support for a misattribution of familiarity account of these data.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">By contrast, fuzzy trace theory provides a compelling explanation for our results (e.g., Brainerd, Wright, Reyna, &amp; Mojardin, 2001; 2003). </span><span class="sentence">According to this theory, the encoding phase produces two representations for each item: a verbatim representation captures the sensory and perceptual details about the item (e.g., visual information about the face of the source with which it is associated), whereas a gist representation captures the meaning of the item. </span><span class="sentence">In the present paradigm, repeated exposure to the doctor-related and lawyer-related items will create very strong gist representations for the meaning of these two themes. </span><span class="sentence">Fuzzy trace theory suggests that phantom (i.e., illusory) recollections can occur in the following manner. </span><span class="sentence">First, the theory predicts that the rapid disintegration of verbatim traces will leave behind fragments of information that are no longer bound together, such as a memory for the picture of the doctor source that is unconnected to the statement with which it was initially paired. </span><span class="sentence">The second critical prediction about the construction of phantom recollections is that strong gist memories will redintegrate verbatim fragments to produce gist-consistent recollective experiences. </span><span class="sentence">For instance, encountering a lawyer-related statement on the test will activate a strong gist memory for this theme, which will then attract and incorporate unconnected verbatim fragments about the lawyer source so as to construct a schema-consistent illusory source recollection.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Overall, then, fuzzy trace theory easily explains the presence of false remember responses to erroneous source attributions with the mechanism that strong gist traces produce schema (i.e., gist)-consistent illusory source recollections. </span><span class="sentence">Moreover, it explains the absence of differences in item recognition—and presumably, familiarity—with the assumption that the strength of the gist traces for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items is unaffected by whether they were presented by the doctor source or the lawyer source.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Experiment 3 tests fuzzy trace theory and our retrieval expectation account. </span><span class="sentence">To distinguish between these two accounts, we modified the paradigm in Experiment 2 and created another expectation about the likely source of the statements that is independent of the expectations associated with the gist of the statements.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In this experiment, we used the identical materials and procedure from Experiment 2 but manipulated the proportion of items presented by the two sources. </span><span class="sentence">The neutral proportion condition replicated Experiment 2 and included equal amounts of the doctor-related and lawyer-related items from each source. </span><span class="sentence">By contrast, in the conflicting proportion condition, only 25% of the items that each source presents were stereotype consistent and 75% were stereotype inconsistent. </span><span class="sentence">For example, 25% of the items that the doctor source presented were doctor-related and 75% of the items were lawyer-related. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, in each proportion condition, participants encountered equivalent numbers of doctor-related and lawyer-related items. </span><span class="sentence">The only difference between the proportion conditions was how these items were distributed between the two sources. </span><span class="sentence">Previous studies show that manipulating the proportion of items that are presented from one source or another changes participants' expectations about the origin of a memory (e.g., Cook et al., 2003; Dodson &amp; Johnson, 1996).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Experiment 3 allowed us to test different predictions of fuzzy trace theory and the retrieval expectation account. </span><span class="sentence">According to fuzzy trace theory, illusory (phantom) recollections are created when strong gist traces attract unconnected verbatim fragments to produce gist-consistent illusory recollections. </span><span class="sentence">From our interpretation of this theory, there does not appear to be a mechanism whereby gist traces would attract verbatim fragments that are inconsistent with the meaning of the gist trace. </span><span class="sentence">In other words, gist-consistent illusory recollections should always be more likely than gist-inconsistent illusory recollections. </span><span class="sentence">Therefore, fuzzy trace theory predicts that the proportion manipulation will have no effect on the pattern of false remember responses. </span><span class="sentence">That is, in both the neutral proportion and conflicting proportion conditions, the pattern of false remember responses should be schema (i.e., gist)-consistent and correspond to the pattern of false remember responses in Experiment 2.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">By contrast, the retrieval expectation account predicts that false remember responses are created by any relevant expectation that is prominent during the act of retrieval. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, this account predicts that the conflicting proportion condition will completely reverse the pattern of false remember responses that is observed in the neutral proportion condition. </span><span class="sentence">Specifically, the neutral proportion condition should produce schema-consistent false remember responses—as it did in Experiment 2—but the conflicting proportion condition should produce schema-inconsistent false remember responses. </span><span class="sentence">This outcome would indicate that the illusory recollections that are stereotype-based can be completely reversed by another overriding set of expectations.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In short, fuzzy trace theory and the retrieval expectation account make opposite predictions about the pattern of false remember responses in the conflicting proportion condition: Fuzzy trace theory predicts that they will be schema consistent, whereas the retrieval expectation account predicts that they will be proportion consistent and, thus, schema inconsistent.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">One remaining crucial aspect of this experiment concerns the remember instructions. </span><span class="sentence">The definition of remember in the instructions from Experiment 2 (which are the standard instructions in the literature) is sufficiently broad that it is possible that idiosyncratic, but non–source-specifying, details might be recollected and lead to a remember response. </span><span class="sentence">For instance, upon seeing a particular test item, participants may not remember any source-identifying details about who presented the item during the study phase, but they may vividly remember how they felt when they saw the item or that their stomach grumbled, which might then contribute to a remember response. </span><span class="sentence">To eliminate the possibility of these source-irrelevant and noncriterial remember judgments, we used a definition of remember that is similar to the manner in which we instructed participants to make a response of Tom or Bill in Experiment 1. </span><span class="sentence">We instructed participants to give remember responses only when they were aware of specific details that identified one source or the other as the origin of the test item.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Forty-eight undergraduate students from the University of Virginia participated in this experiment, with 24 participants in each of the two conditions.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design and Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Except for the noted differences, the overall design and materials were identical to those used in Experiment 2. </span><span class="sentence">The stimuli consisted of 96 sentences, with 48 containing doctor-related information and 48 containing lawyer-related information. </span><span class="sentence">There were no neutral statements in this experiment. </span><span class="sentence">Each group of 48 sentences was divided into six subgroups (i.e., with 8 sentences per subgroup) that served to counterbalance the statements across: (a) the doctor, lawyer, and new sources and (b) the two proportion conditions. </span><span class="sentence">During the encoding phase, participants were presented with 64 statements. </span><span class="sentence">In the neutral proportion condition, 32 of these statements were presented by the stereotype-consistent source and 32 statements were presented by the stereotype-inconsistent source (e.g., the doctor source presented 16 of the doctor-related items and 16 of the lawyer-related items). </span><span class="sentence">By contrast, in the conflicting proportion condition, 48 of the profession statements were presented by the stereotype-inconsistent source and 16 statements were presented by the consistent source (e.g., the doctor source presented 24 of the lawyer-related items and 8 of the doctor-related items, and the lawyer source presented 24 of the doctor-related items and 8 of the lawyer-related items). </span><span class="sentence">The test contained all 96 statements (64 old items and 32 new items). </span><span class="sentence">All other details were identical to the those presented in the Method section of Experiment 2.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">During the study phase, as in the preceding experiments, participants were told that they would see sentences that were associated with the name and picture of one of two men, Tom and Bill. </span><span class="sentence">Participants rated how easily they could imagine the pictured person saying the associated sentence. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were not informed of either the impending memory test or the proportion of doctor-related and lawyer-related sentences that were presented by the two sources. </span><span class="sentence">During the test phase, as in the previous experiments, participants were told that it might be helpful to know that one source is actually a doctor and the other source is actually a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence">In addition, participants in the conflicting proportion condition were informed about the proportion manipulation. </span><span class="sentence">They were told that they might have noticed that “Tom presented most of the lawyer-related statements and Bill presented most of the doctor-related statements.” </span><span class="sentence">Finally, as in the prior experiments, the name, photo, and assigned profession (e.g., Tom, doctor) of each source were shown throughout the test.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The format of the memory test was identical to the format used in Experiment 2. </span><span class="sentence">Participants responded either Tom, Bill, or new to each test item and, contingent on a response of either Tom or Bill, participants identified the basis of their source identification by giving a remember or know response. </span><span class="sentence">However, we changed the instructions slightly for giving a remember response. </span><span class="sentence">We directed participants to make remember responses in instances in which their</span></p><blockquote><span class="sentence">memory of who originally presented the statement is accompanied by a conscious recollection of its prior occurrence in the list of studied statements. </span><span class="sentence">Remember is the ability to become consciously aware again of some aspect of how the sentence was presented, such as aspects of the physical appearance of the sentence and the accompanying picture of Bill or Tom. </span><span class="sentence">In other words the “remembered” answer should bring back to mind a particular visual image or recollective details of the statement and its presenter.</span></blockquote> By contrast, participants were directed to give know judgments when “you recognize that the sentence was in the study set but you cannot consciously recollect anything about its actual occurrence and how it was presented.”
