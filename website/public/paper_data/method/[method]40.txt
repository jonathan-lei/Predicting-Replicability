<h3>Experiment 3</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong> about the origin of a statement can be created by providing stereotype information at <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> that draws on well-learned semantic categories about doctors and lawyers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There are a variety of different explanations for the occurrence of <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong>. In other paradigms, misattribution of strong familiarity is a plausible explanation for <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong> (i.e., false remember responses). For instance, in the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm, participants tend to give high rates of remember responses to new words (e.g., <em>sleep</em>) that appear familiar because they are semantically related to what was studied (e.g., <em>tired, dream, pillow, rest</em>; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995). More recently, Chan and McDermott (2006) observed a similar effect when participants make pragmatic inference errors. For instance, after hearing that a “flimsy shelf weakened under the weight of the books,” participants later often incorrectly recognize that they had heard the word <em>broke</em> and give high levels of remember responses to this false recognition. Drawing on the signal detection account of Wixted and Stretch (2004; see also Donaldson, 1996), Chan and McDermott suggested that the high rates of false remember responses may be due to the misattribution of strong familiarity. According to Wixted and Stretch (2004), participants make remember and know responses on the basis of a single dimension of <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> strength, which is based on the overall amount of information that is provided by separate remember and familiarity processes. Consequently, a remember response can be due to the presence of (a) a large amount of remember information and little familiarity information, (b) a large amount of familiarity information and little remember information, or (c) a large amount of both kinds of information. Thus, from this point of view, in both the DRM and pragmatic-inference paradigms, the strong familiarity that is associated with the semantically related lure items on the test may account for erroneous remember responses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This misattribution of strong familiarity account, however, cannot easily explain the false remember responses in the present paradigm. In contrast to the foregoing paradigms in which participants incorrectly endorse new words as old, in our paradigm participants must attribute items that are already recognized as old to one <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> or the other and give a remember or know response as a basis for this <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> attribution. To explain the high levels of false remember responses to erroneous <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> attributions, the misattribution of familiarity account must predict that items are more familiar when participants respond in a schema-consistent manner than when they respond in a schema-inconsistent manner (e.g., higher familiarity when incorrectly providing a doctor response to the doctor-related items than when incorrectly providing a doctor response to the lawyer-related items). There was no support for this prediction. If there had been differences in familiarity between the items, then this would have produced differences in item recognition. However, recognition rates—as measured by the <em>D</em> parameter, which is equivalent to a corrected recognition score—were no different for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items when they were presented by either a mismatching or matching <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong>. Yet, despite the absence of these <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> differences, there were strong differences in the pattern of <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong>. Thus, there is no support for a misattribution of familiarity account of these data.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By contrast, fuzzy trace theory provides a compelling explanation for our results (e.g., Brainerd, Wright, Reyna, &amp; Mojardin, 2001; 2003). According to this theory, the encoding phase produces two representations for each item: a verbatim representation captures the sensory and perceptual details about the item (e.g., visual information about the face of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> with which it is associated), whereas a gist representation captures the meaning of the item. In the present paradigm, repeated exposure to the doctor-related and lawyer-related items will create very strong gist representations for the meaning of these two themes. Fuzzy trace theory suggests that phantom (i.e., <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong>) <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong> can occur in the following manner. First, the theory predicts that the rapid disintegration of verbatim traces will leave behind fragments of information that are no longer bound together, such as a <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> for the picture of the doctor <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> that is unconnected to the statement with which it was initially paired. The second critical prediction about the construction of phantom <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong> is that strong gist memories will redintegrate verbatim fragments to produce gist-consistent recollective experiences. For instance, encountering a lawyer-related statement on the test will activate a strong gist <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> for this theme, which will then attract and incorporate unconnected verbatim fragments about the lawyer <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> so as to construct a schema-consistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> recollection.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, then, fuzzy trace theory easily explains the presence of false remember responses to erroneous <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> attributions with the mechanism that strong gist traces produce schema (i.e., gist)-consistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong>. Moreover, it explains the absence of differences in item recognition—and presumably, familiarity—with the assumption that the strength of the gist traces for the doctor-related and lawyer-related items is unaffected by whether they were presented by the doctor <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> or the lawyer <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 3 tests fuzzy trace theory and our <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> expectation account. To distinguish between these two accounts, we modified the paradigm in Experiment 2 and created another expectation about the likely <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> of the statements that is independent of the expectations associated with the gist of the statements.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this experiment, we used the identical materials and procedure from Experiment 2 but manipulated the proportion of items presented by the two sources. The neutral proportion condition replicated Experiment 2 and included equal amounts of the doctor-related and lawyer-related items from each <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong>. By contrast, in the conflicting proportion condition, only 25% of the items that each <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> presents were stereotype consistent and 75% were stereotype inconsistent. For example, 25% of the items that the doctor <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> presented were doctor-related and 75% of the items were lawyer-related. Thus, in each proportion condition, participants encountered equivalent numbers of doctor-related and lawyer-related items. The only difference between the proportion conditions was how these items were distributed between the two sources. Previous studies show that manipulating the proportion of items that are presented from one <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> or another changes participants' expectations about the origin of a <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> (e.g., Cook et al., 2003; Dodson &amp; Johnson, 1996).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 3 allowed us to test different predictions of fuzzy trace theory and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> expectation account. According to fuzzy trace theory, <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> (phantom) <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong> are created when strong gist traces attract unconnected verbatim fragments to produce gist-consistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong>. From our interpretation of this theory, there does not appear to be a mechanism whereby gist traces would attract verbatim fragments that are inconsistent with the meaning of the gist trace. In other words, gist-consistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong> should always be more likely than gist-inconsistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong>. Therefore, fuzzy trace theory predicts that the proportion manipulation will have no effect on the pattern of false remember responses. That is, in both the neutral proportion and conflicting proportion conditions, the pattern of false remember responses should be schema (i.e., gist)-consistent and correspond to the pattern of false remember responses in Experiment 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By contrast, the <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> expectation account predicts that false remember responses are created by any relevant expectation that is prominent during the act of <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong>. Thus, this account predicts that the conflicting proportion condition will completely reverse the pattern of false remember responses that is observed in the neutral proportion condition. Specifically, the neutral proportion condition should produce schema-consistent false remember responses—as it did in Experiment 2—but the conflicting proportion condition should produce schema-inconsistent false remember responses. This outcome would indicate that the <strong data-auto="strong_text">illusory</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">recollections</strong> that are stereotype-based can be completely reversed by another overriding set of expectations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In short, fuzzy trace theory and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> expectation account make opposite predictions about the pattern of false remember responses in the conflicting proportion condition: Fuzzy trace theory predicts that they will be schema consistent, whereas the <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> expectation account predicts that they will be proportion consistent and, thus, schema inconsistent.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One remaining crucial aspect of this experiment concerns the remember instructions. The definition of remember in the instructions from Experiment 2 (which are the standard instructions in the literature) is sufficiently broad that it is possible that idiosyncratic, but non–<strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong>-specifying, details might be recollected and lead to a remember response. For instance, upon seeing a particular test item, participants may not remember any <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong>-identifying details about who presented the item during the study phase, but they may vividly remember how they felt when they saw the item or that their stomach grumbled, which might then contribute to a remember response. To eliminate the possibility of these <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong>-irrelevant and noncriterial remember judgments, we used a definition of remember that is similar to the manner in which we instructed participants to make a response of Tom or Bill in Experiment 1. We instructed participants to give remember responses only when they were aware of specific details that identified one <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> or the other as the origin of the test item.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Forty-eight undergraduate students from the University of Virginia participated in this experiment, with 24 participants in each of the two conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design and Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Except for the noted differences, the overall design and materials were identical to those used in Experiment 2. The stimuli consisted of 96 sentences, with 48 containing doctor-related information and 48 containing lawyer-related information. There were no neutral statements in this experiment. Each group of 48 sentences was divided into six subgroups (i.e., with 8 sentences per subgroup) that served to counterbalance the statements across: (a) the doctor, lawyer, and new sources and (b) the two proportion conditions. During the encoding phase, participants were presented with 64 statements. In the neutral proportion condition, 32 of these statements were presented by the stereotype-consistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> and 32 statements were presented by the stereotype-inconsistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> (e.g., the doctor <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> presented 16 of the doctor-related items and 16 of the lawyer-related items). By contrast, in the conflicting proportion condition, 48 of the profession statements were presented by the stereotype-inconsistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> and 16 statements were presented by the consistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> (e.g., the doctor <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> presented 24 of the lawyer-related items and 8 of the doctor-related items, and the lawyer <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> presented 24 of the doctor-related items and 8 of the lawyer-related items). The test contained all 96 statements (64 old items and 32 new items). All other details were identical to the those presented in the Method section of Experiment 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">During the study phase, as in the preceding experiments, participants were told that they would see sentences that were associated with the name and picture of one of two men, Tom and Bill. Participants rated how easily they could imagine the pictured person saying the associated sentence. Participants were not informed of either the impending <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> test or the proportion of doctor-related and lawyer-related sentences that were presented by the two sources. During the test phase, as in the previous experiments, participants were told that it might be helpful to know that one <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> is actually a doctor and the other <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> is actually a lawyer. In addition, participants in the conflicting proportion condition were informed about the proportion manipulation. They were told that they might have noticed that “Tom presented most of the lawyer-related statements and Bill presented most of the doctor-related statements.” Finally, as in the prior experiments, the name, photo, and assigned profession (e.g., Tom, doctor) of each <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> were shown throughout the test.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The format of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> test was identical to the format used in Experiment 2. Participants responded either Tom, Bill, or new to each test item and, contingent on a response of either Tom or Bill, participants identified the basis of their <strong data-auto="strong_text">source</strong> identification by giving a remember or know response. However, we changed the instructions slightly for giving a remember response. We directed participants to make remember responses in instances in which their
<blockquote>memory of who originally presented the statement is accompanied by a conscious recollection of its prior occurrence in the list of studied statements. Remember is the ability to become consciously aware again of some aspect of how the sentence was presented, such as aspects of the physical appearance of the sentence and the accompanying picture of Bill or Tom. In other words the “remembered” answer should bring back to mind a particular visual image or recollective details of the statement and its presenter.</blockquote> By contrast, participants were directed to give know judgments when “you recognize that the sentence was in the study set but you cannot consciously recollect anything about its actual occurrence and how it was presented.”</p>
