<h3>Study 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In Study 1, <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong> was measured using a questionnaire. The correlation between participants' self-reported <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong> and the PSD patterns derived from their response times suggests that <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong> can moderate 1/<em>f</em> <strong data-auto="strong_text">noise</strong>. Study 2 sought to bolster this claim by experimentally manipulating participants' <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong> on a separate computer-based measure of racial <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This research essentially strives to recreate a study conducted by Payne and his colleagues (Payne et al., 2002), who asked participants to either accentuate or avoid the use of racial cues in a weapon-identification paradigm. Like the shoot/don't-shoot task in Study 1, this task assesses racial <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong> in reactions to guns and harmless objects. On a series of trials, participants were primed with either a Black face or a White face. They were then asked to identify a target image as either a gun or a tool. In their study, Payne and his colleagues varied the instructions they gave to participants. Participants in the control condition were simply asked to perform the task to the best of their ability. A second group was asked to perform the task but was specifically instructed to avoid the use of race. They were not to allow the race of the prime to influence their judgments. A third group was explicitly asked to make use of race during the performance of the task. They were asked to behave like racial profilers. Payne found greater <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong> in both experimental conditions. This finding makes perfect sense for the participants who were instructed to act like profilers. They were simply doing what they were told. But, ironically, the participants who were asked to avoid using the racial cues showed increases in <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong>. Relative to controls, they showed stronger associations between Blacks and guns. The authors suggested that because the instructions called attention to the race of the prime, participants in the experimental conditions were more susceptible to race-based associations (whether that influence was consistent or inconsistent with their instructions).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to demonstrating an interesting and counterintuitive effect, Payne et al.'s (2002) study has clear implications for task-relevant <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong>. Participants in the control condition approached the task without any experimentally imposed demands. By contrast, participants in both the avoid-race and use-race conditions were asked to consciously control or modulate their performance. Whether or not their efforts were ultimately successful, these participants approached the task with additional experimentally imposed demands. If 1/<em>f</em> <strong data-auto="strong_text">noise</strong> is sensitive to increased <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong>, spectral analysis should reveal differences between the relatively minimal <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong> required of the control condition and the greater <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong> required of the experimental conditions.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Seventy-one undergraduates participated in return for course credit. All participants performed a simple task in which they were asked to classify objects that appeared on a computer screen as either guns or tools. Prior to the presentation of the target object, however, participants were primed with either a Black or a White face (Payne, 2001). Although all participants performed the same task, individuals were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, each imposing a different task-relevant goal. Participants in the control condition were given no specific instructions; participants in the avoid-race condition were instructed not to use racial information when making their decisions; participants in the use-race condition were instructed to let racial cues guide their behavior during the task. This study followed a 3 (instructions: control vs. avoid race vs. use race) × 2 (prime race: Black vs. White) × 2 (object type: gun vs. tool) mixed-model design, with repeated <strong data-auto="strong_text">measures</strong> on the last two factors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The weapon-identification task was based on the paradigm developed by Payne (2001, Study 1). The task consisted of a 25-trial practice phase followed by a test phase of 200 trials. Each trial began with the presentation of a prime face (200 ms). Primes consisted of black-and-white photographs (faces only) of five Black men and five White men. Immediately after the prime, a target object appeared (200 ms). Target stimuli consisted of black-and-white photographs of 5 guns and 5 power tools (drills, screwdrivers, etc). After 200 ms, the target image was replaced with a mask (a random pattern of black and white rectangles), which remained on screen until the participant responded. A 1,000-ms intertrial interval preceded the onset of the next prime.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the original study, Payne and his colleagues (2002) forced participants to respond within 700–1,200 ms after the onset of the object image. They also presented the target object for only 100 ms (rather than 200 ms, as in the present research). Payne et al.'s parameters were presumably motivated by their interest in process dissociation procedure estimates of control and automatic <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong>, which are derived from patterns of errors (see also Payne, 2001, Study 2). More restrictive time limits tend to increase the likelihood of errors in these tasks. By contrast, the current research focuses on variance in reaction times, and forcing participants to respond within a given time window carries with it the possibility that participants will respond too slowly on some trials, resulting in missing data, which (as noted above) are problematic for the analysis. The test phase of Study 2 therefore imposed no response deadline. To encourage participants to respond quickly, the practice phase imposed a deadline of 1,000 ms. Participants who responded too slowly during the initial 25 trials received a message to that effect. Fewer than 1% of responses exceeded 1,000 ms during the test phase.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A White male experimenter introduced the study as an investigation of vigilance. He seated participants in individual rooms, each equipped with a computer. A randomly selected computer program delivered the instructions, which constituted the experimental manipulation. These instructions were taken directly from Payne et al. (2002).</p>
