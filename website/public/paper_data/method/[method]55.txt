<h3>Experiment 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experiment 1 was based on the list-completion procedure (e.g., Allport et al., 1994; Jersild, 1927). In this procedure three types of lists are presented: (a) a pure list containing only <strong data-auto="strong_text">Task</strong> A, (b) a pure list containing only <strong data-auto="strong_text">Task</strong> B, and (c) a mixed list in which participants have to alternate between <strong data-auto="strong_text">Task</strong> A and <strong data-auto="strong_text">Task</strong> B. The switch cost is computed as the difference between the mean latencies (and error rates) of both pure lists and the mixed list. Although this method has proven to be useful in many investigations of <strong data-auto="strong_text">task</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">switching</strong> (e.g., Baddeley et al., 2001; Emerson &amp; Miyake, 2003; Saeki &amp; Saito, 2004a, 2004b), it is important to note that the cost observed in this situation does reflect a broad range of demands and processes that are not all specific to <strong data-auto="strong_text">task</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">switching</strong>. For this reason, it is more appropriate to refer to this cost as a <em>global <strong data-auto="strong_text">switching</strong> cost</em> (e.g., Kray &amp; Lindenberger, 2000; Mayr, 2001). An advantage of this method is that the difference between pure and mixed lists is large and robust. In view of the present purpose, namely finding evidence for an effect of <strong data-auto="strong_text">task</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">switching</strong> on <strong data-auto="strong_text">working</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> storage, it seems appropriate to start with such a large effect. If no difference is observed under these conditions, the search for a cognitive cost associated with more fine grained measures of <strong data-auto="strong_text">task</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">switching</strong> is futile.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The present experiment compared recall performance in continuous span tasks including either pure lists or mixed lists of tasks. Participants were presented with a number of consonants to be remembered. After each consonant, they were presented with a series of digits to be processed according to the list completion paradigm. Pure lists involved either parity or magnitude judgments, whereas mixed lists required participants to alternate between parity and magnitude judgments of the digits. We predicted poorer recall in the mixed list than in the pure list conditions.</p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Nineteen first-year <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> students at Ghent University participated for course requirements and credit. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were right-handed, and were naïve to the purpose of the experiment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Tasks and material</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A continuous span <strong data-auto="strong_text">task</strong> designed by Barrouillet et al. (2004) was used. During a continuous span <strong data-auto="strong_text">task</strong>, two constituent tasks need to be coordinated. Participants were presented with series of three to six consonants to be remembered. Consonants in each series were drawn from 13 groups with low intergroup confusability based on their Dutch pronunciation (Vandierendonck, De Vooght, &amp; Van der Goten, 1998). These groups were: (<em>B, D, P, T</em>), (<em>C</em>), (<em>F, S</em>), (<em>G</em>), (<em>H, K</em>), (<em>J</em>), (<em>L</em>), (<em>M, N</em>), (<em>Q</em>), (<em>R</em>), (<em>V, W</em>), (<em>X</em>), (<em>Z</em>). After each consonant, a series of eight digits (from 1 to 9, without 5) colored in either red or blue was sequentially displayed on screen. These series were randomly generated with the restriction that immediate stimulus repetition was avoided. When the digit was red, the participants had to decide whether it was larger or smaller than 5, by pressing a right or a left key, respectively. If it was blue, participants judged its parity by pressing the right or the left key for even and odd numbers, respectively. Previous research has shown that these response mappings are consistent with the mental representations of numbers in long-term <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong>, thus avoiding spurious compatibility effects (Dehaene, Bossini, &amp; Giraux, 1993; Nuerk, Iversen, &amp; Willmes, 2004). For both judgments the right hand had to be used.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Three types of digit lists were created: (a) 8 lists containing only parity judgments; (b) 8 lists containing only magnitude comparisons, and (c) 16 mixed lists in which the participants had to alternate between the parity and the magnitude tasks. In this way, for each length of the letter sequence (three, four, five, or six consonants), 4 simple and 4 mixed lists were presented. This resulted in a total of 32 lists to be performed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The participants were tested in groups of two by means of Pentium III personal computers with 17-inch color monitors running the Tscope experimentation software (Stevens, Lammertyn, Verbruggen, &amp; Vandierendonck, 2006). The instructions were presented on-screen and paraphrased if necessary. A practice session of three blocks preceded the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> sessions. In the first practice block, one letter series of each length was presented, and participants had to memorize the consonants without processing the digits presented after each consonant. In the second block, participants processed the digits without memorizing the consonants, whereas in the last block, both letter memorization and digit processing had to be performed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After these three practice blocks, the experiment proper started. The letter–digit lists were presented in a random order. The course of events for each list was as follows: First, the length and the type of the list were announced in the middle of the screen (e.g., “4 consonants—magnitude <strong data-auto="strong_text">task</strong>”). Second, a consonant was presented for 1,500 ms, followed by a 300-ms blank. Next, a digit appeared for 900 ms followed by a 300-ms blank. When the eight digits were presented, the next consonant appeared, and so on. The time course of these events was fixed. Even when participants did not respond to the digits, the sequence continued. At the end of a list, participants had to recall the consonants in the correct order by typing the letters on the keyboard with their left hand. The recalled consonants were presented on a display on-screen. Whenever the participants had forgotten an item, they pressed the spacebar and a question mark appeared instead of a letter. The experiment lasted about 1 hr.</p>
