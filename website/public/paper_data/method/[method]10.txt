<div class="sectionInfo"><h2 class="sectionHeading">METHOD</h2></div><p><span class="sentence">Thirty-one undergraduate students (26 male, 5 female) participated in this study. </span><span class="sentence">No participants discontinued their participation in the experiment once it had begun, and all received course credit for their participation.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">The task was an arrow version of the flankers task (cf. Hajcak et al., 2005). </span><span class="sentence">On each trial, five horizontally aligned arrowheads were presented, and participants had to respond to the direction of the central arrowhead by pressing the left or right mouse button. </span><span class="sentence">On compatible trials, all five arrowheads pointed in the same direction (either left or right), and on incompatible trials, the central arrowhead pointed in the direction opposite the direction of the flanking arrowheads. </span><span class="sentence">Compatible and incompatible trials were equally frequent, and all stimuli were presented for 200 ms with an intertrial interval that varied randomly from 500 to 1,000 ms. Participants performed eight blocks of 30 trials. </span><span class="sentence">At the end of each block, participants received performance feedback designed to encourage fast and accurate responding. </span><span class="sentence">If performance was 75% correct or lower, the message “Please try to be more accurate” was displayed; performance above 90% correct was followed by “Please try to respond faster”; if performance was between these levels, the message “You're doing a great job” was displayed. </span><span class="sentence">All participants performed one practice block of 30 trials.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">The startle response was measured using standard procedures for assessing defensive reactivity (Bradley et al., 2005, 2006; Curtin et al., 2001; Grillon et al., 1993; Lang et al., 2000): Startle was elicited with a 105-dB burst of white noise that had a 50-ms duration and instantaneous rise time. </span><span class="sentence">The startle probe was delivered on 10% of all trials in the practice block; in the actual experiment, startle probes were presented on 50% of error trials, on 50% of correct trials that followed errors, and on a random 4% of other correct trials. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, some startle probes were predictable (after both errors and correct trials that followed errors), whereas others were not (randomly selected correct trials). </span><span class="sentence">Accordingly, there were three trial types: error trials, predictable correct trials (i.e., correct trials on which the startle probe was predictable), and unpredictable correct trials (i.e., correct trials on which the startle probe was not predictable). </span><span class="sentence">In all cases, the startle probe was presented 300 ms after the response.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded using an ActiveTwo head cap and the ActiveTwo BioSemi system (BioSemi, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). </span><span class="sentence">Recordings were taken from 64 scalp electrodes based on the ten-twenty system, as well as from two electrodes placed on the left and right mastoids. </span><span class="sentence">The electrooculogram (EOG) generated from blinks and eye movements was recorded from four facial electrodes: two approximately 1 cm above and below the participant's right eye, one approximately 1 cm to the left of the left eye, and one approximately 1 cm to the right of the right eye. </span><span class="sentence">The startle response was measured with two electrodes placed approximately 12 mm apart under the participant's left eye on the obicularis muscle. </span><span class="sentence">As per BioSemi's design, the ground electrode during acquisition was formed by the Common Mode Sense active electrode and the Driven Right Leg passive electrode. </span><span class="sentence">All bioelectric signals were digitized on a laboratory microcomputer using ActiView software (BioSemi). </span><span class="sentence">Sampling was at 1024 Hz.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Off-line analysis was performed using Brain Vision Analyzer software (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). </span><span class="sentence">For the startle data, EMG activity was band-pass filtered (28–512 Hz; 24 dB/octave roll-off), rectified, then low-pass filtered at 30 Hz (24 dB/octave) and baseline-corrected. </span><span class="sentence">Individual trials were examined and rejected if the startle reflex began less than 20 ms following probe onset. </span><span class="sentence">The number of excluded startle trials was 1.42 (<i>SD</i> = 1.43) for predictable correct trials, 1.42 (<i>SD</i> = 1.57) for unpredictable correct trials, and 2.26 (<i>SD</i> = 2.42) for error trials.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">EEG data were rereferenced to the numeric mean of the mastoids and band-pass filtered with cutoffs of 0.1 and 30 Hz. </span><span class="sentence">The EEG was segmented for each trial, beginning 200 ms before the response and continuing for 800 ms. The EEG was corrected for blinks and eye movements using the method developed by Gratton, Coles, and Donchin (1983). </span><span class="sentence">Specific intervals for individual channels were rejected in each trial using a semiautomated procedure, with physiological artifacts identified by the following criteria: a voltage step of more than 50.0 μV between sample points, a voltage difference of more than 300.0 μV within a trial, and a maximum voltage difference of less than 0.50 μV within a 100-ms interval. </span><span class="sentence">The average number of trials excluded from ERP analyses was 2.03 (<i>SD</i> = 5.22), or 0.87% of possible trials.</span></p><p><span class="sentence">Startle response magnitudes and latencies were quantified in terms of the peak in the 20- to 120-ms window after the presentation of the startle probe. </span><span class="sentence">The ERN was defined as the average activity in a 0- to 100-ms window following response onset on error trials. </span><span class="sentence">The ERN and startle responses were statistically evaluated using SPSS (Version 14.0) General Linear Model software, with Greenhouse-Geisser correction applied to <i>p</i> values associated with multiple-<i>df</i>, repeated measures comparisons.</span></p>
