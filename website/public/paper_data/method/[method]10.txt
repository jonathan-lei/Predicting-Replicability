<span class="medium-bold"><h3>Experiment 1</h3></span><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the size comparison paradigm, pairs of digits varying in physical and numerical magnitudes are presented on a computer screen. </span><span class="sentence">In the physical comparison task, participants are asked to choose the physically larger digit while ignoring numerical magnitude. </span><span class="sentence">Automaticity of processing of numerical magnitude is indicated by the size congruency effect (SiCE), which is indicated in poorer performance in the incongruent condition (when the physically larger digit is numerically smaller) than in the congruent condition (when the physically larger digit is also numerically larger; e.g., Henik &amp; Tzelgov, 1982; Pansky &amp; Algom, 1999; Tzelgov, Meyer, &amp; Henik, 1992).</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The SiCE is viewed as indicating that the numerical magnitudes of the two presented digits were automatically processed and compared with each other. </span><span class="sentence">Some studies (e.g., Ganor-Stern et al., 2007) found that the SiCE increased with larger intrapair numerical difference, thus suggesting also the activation of the whole number line (see Tzelgov &amp; Ganor-Stern, 2005, for a discussion of this point). </span><span class="sentence">However, this interaction of the SiCE and numerical difference was not always obtained (e.g., Rubinsten, Henik, Berger, &amp; Shahar-Shalev, 2002). </span><span class="sentence">In the present study, we look at the SiCE (i.e., the difference in performance between congruent and incongruent conditions) and at its interaction with numerical difference for both same- and different-notation pairs.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Finally, participants also performed the numerical comparison task in which they had to select the numerically larger digit. </span><span class="sentence">The analysis of this task mainly focused on the CDE with same- and different-notation pairs.</span></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">Twenty students of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel) or Achva Academic College (Israel) participated in the experiment. </span><span class="sentence">All of them were native speakers of Arabic, who studied in a Hebrew-speaking academic institute. </span><span class="sentence">They participated either for course credits or payment.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The stimuli set was composed by all the possible 28 pairs created from two different numbers in the range of 1–9, excluding 5. </span><span class="sentence">There were thus eight numerical differences, ranging from 1–8. </span><span class="sentence">Each number pair appeared in the following three notations: Arabic, Indian, and Mixed notations (including both Arabic–Indian pairs and Indian–Arabic pairs). </span><span class="sentence">Each of the pairs appeared twice, once with the larger number on the left side and the other with the smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 224 trials. </span><span class="sentence">Each number was about 15 mm high and 10 mm wide, and the distance between the centers of the digits was 6.5 mm.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">In the physical comparison task, the numbers presented were in one of two physical sizes: large (18 × 11 mm) and small (12 × 8 mm). </span><span class="sentence">Each number pair appeared four times: twice in the congruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically larger size) and twice in the incongruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically smaller size). </span><span class="sentence">In addition, within each congruency condition, each pair appeared once with the numerically larger number on the left side and once with the numerically smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 448 trials.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment was conducted on a Pentium IBM clone personal computer with a 14-in. [35.56-cm] monitor screen. </span><span class="sentence">The experiment was programmed in E-Prime software (Schneider, Eschman, &amp; Zuccolotto, 2002)</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The experiment was conducted individually. </span><span class="sentence">Each participant performed both the physical and the numerical comparison tasks. </span><span class="sentence">The order of tasks was counterbalanced across participants. </span><span class="sentence">There was a short rest break between the two tasks as well as after each sequence of 112 trials.</span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="sentence">The participant sat about 50 cm from the computer screen. </span><span class="sentence">The trial started with a fixation cross that appeared at the center of the screen for 500 ms. </span><span class="sentence">Then two numbers appeared, each was 3 cm apart from the screen center. </span><span class="sentence">In the numerical comparison task, participants were required to select the numerically larger digit. </span><span class="sentence">In the physical comparison task, they had to select the physically larger digit while ignoring numerical magnitudes. </span><span class="sentence">Participants responded by pressing either the “L” key for the right number or the “A” key for the left one. </span><span class="sentence">In both tasks, participants were required to respond as fast as possible but to avoid errors. </span><span class="sentence">The numbers remained on the screen until the participant's response.</span></p>
