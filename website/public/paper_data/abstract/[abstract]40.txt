<span class="sentence">      In a serial recall task, the Hebb repetition effect occurs when recall performance improves for a sequence repeated throughout the experimental session. </span><span class="sentence">This phenomenon has been replicated many times. </span><span class="sentence">Nevertheless, such cumulative learning seldom leads to perfect recall of the whole sequence, and errors persist. </span><span class="sentence">Here the authors report evidence that there is another side to the Hebb repetition effect that involves learning errors produced in a repeated sequence. </span><span class="sentence">A learning measure based on past recalls (correct or incorrect) shows that the probability of a given response increases with the number of prior occurrences of that response. </span><span class="sentence">The pattern of results reveals another manifestation of the Hebb repetition effect and speaks to the nature of implicit learning.</span>
