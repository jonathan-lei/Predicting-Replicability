<span class="sentence">      Implicit and explicit attitude tests are often weakly correlated, leading some theorists to conclude that implicit and explicit cognition are independent. </span><span class="sentence">Popular implicit and explicit tests, however, differ in many ways beyond implicit and explicit cognition. </span><span class="sentence">The authors examined in 4 studies whether correlations between implicit and explicit tests were influenced by the similarity in task demands (i.e., structural fit) and, hence, the processes engaged by each test. </span><span class="sentence">Using an affect misattribution procedure, they systematically varied the structural fit of implicit and explicit tests of racial attitudes. </span><span class="sentence">As test formats became more similar, the implicit-explicit correlation increased until it became higher than in most previous research. </span><span class="sentence">When tests differ in structure, they may underestimate the relationship between implicit and explicit cognition. </span><span class="sentence">The authors propose a solution that uses procedures to maximize structural fit.</span>
