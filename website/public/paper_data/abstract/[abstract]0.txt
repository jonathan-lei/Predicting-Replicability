<span class="sentence">      Phenomena that vary over time can often be represented as a complex waveform. </span><span class="sentence">Fourier analysis decomposes this complex wave into a set of sinusoidal component waves. </span><span class="sentence">In some phenomena, the amplitude of these waves varies in inverse relation to frequency. </span><span class="sentence">This pattern has been called 1/f noise and, unlike white noise, it reflects nonrandom variation. </span><span class="sentence">Latencies in simple computer tasks typically reveal 1/f noise, but the magnitude of the noise decreases as tasks become more challenging. </span><span class="sentence">The current work hypothesizes a correspondence between 1/f noise and effort, leading to the prediction that increasing effort will reduce 1/f noise. </span><span class="sentence">In 2 studies, the author examined the relationship between an individual's attempts to avoid bias (measured in Study 1, manipulated in Study 2) and 1/f noise in implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice. </span><span class="sentence">In each study, participants who made an effort to modulate the use of racial information showed less 1/f noise than did participants who made less effort. </span><span class="sentence">The potential value of this analytic approach to social psychology is discussed.</span>
