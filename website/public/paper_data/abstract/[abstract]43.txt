<span class="sentence">      The authors propose a global/local processing style model (GLOMO) for assimilation and contrast effects in social judgment. </span><span class="sentence">GLOMO is based on Schwarz and Bless' (1992, 2007) inclusion-exclusion model, which suggests that when information is included into a category, assimilation occurs, whereas when information is excluded from a category, contrast occurs. </span><span class="sentence">According to GLOMO, inclusion versus exclusion should be influenced by whether people process information globally or locally. </span><span class="sentence">In 5 experiments, using both disambiguation and social comparison, the authors induced local versus global processing through perceptual tasks and time perspective and showed that global processing produced assimilation, whereas local processing produced contrast. </span><span class="sentence">The experiments showed that processing styles elicited in one task can carry over to other tasks and influence social judgments. </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, they found that hemisphere activation and accessibility of judgment-consistent knowledge partially mediated these effects. </span><span class="sentence">Implications for current and classic models of social judgment are discussed.</span>
