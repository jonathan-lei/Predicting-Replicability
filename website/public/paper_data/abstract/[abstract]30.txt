<span class="sentence">This experiment used the attraction effect to test the hypothesis that ingestion of sugar can reduce reliance on intuitive, heuristic-based decision making. </span><span class="sentence">In the attraction effect, a difficult choice between two options is swayed by the presence of a seemingly irrelevant “decoy” option. </span><span class="sentence">We replicated this effect and the finding that the effect increases when people have depleted their mental resources performing a previous self-control task. </span><span class="sentence">Our hypothesis was based on the assumption that effortful processes require and consume relatively large amounts of glucose (brain fuel), and that this use of glucose is why people use heuristic strategies after exerting self-control. </span><span class="sentence">Before performing any tasks, some participants drank lemonade sweetened with sugar, which restores blood glucose, whereas others drank lemonade containing a sugar substitute. </span><span class="sentence">Only lemonade with sugar reduced the attraction effect. </span><span class="sentence">These results show one way in which the body (blood glucose) interacts with the mind (self-control and reliance on heuristics).</span>
