<span class="sentence">      A variety of experimental evidence indicates that the memory representation for multiplication facts (e.g., 6 x 9 = 54) incorporates bidirectional links with a forward association from factors to product and a reverse association from product to factors. </span><span class="sentence">Surprisingly, the authors did not find evidence in Experiment 1 of facilitative transfer-of-practice from multiplication (6 x 9 = ?) </span><span class="sentence">to factoring (54 = ? </span><span class="sentence">x ?); in fact, multiplication practice produced item-specific interference with factoring. </span><span class="sentence">Similarly, the authors found no evidence in Experiment 2 that repetition of specific factoring problems (54 = ? </span><span class="sentence">x ?) </span><span class="sentence">facilitated performance of corresponding multiplication problems (6 x 9 = ?). </span><span class="sentence">In Experiment 3, participants practiced both multiplication and factoring and presented facilitative transfer in both directions. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, bidirectional facilitation occurred if both operations were practiced, but interference occurred when only one operation was practiced. </span><span class="sentence">We propose that this seemingly paradoxical behavior occurs because it is adaptive for the bidirectional retrieval structure to retain operational flexibility in the context of practicing both operations, whereas it is adaptive to specialize the memory representation for the practiced operation (i.e., factoring or multiplication) when only one operation is practiced.</span>
