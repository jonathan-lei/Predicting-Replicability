<span class="sentence">      Typically, the phonological similarity between to-be-recalled items and TBI auditory stimuli has no impact if recall in serial order is required. </span><span class="sentence">However, in the present study, the authors have shown that the free recall, but not serial recall, of lists of phonologically related to-be-remembered items was disrupted by an irrelevant sound stream (end rhymes) sharing similar phonological content. </span><span class="sentence">These findings can be explained by the notion that between-sequence phonological similarity effects emerge when category-cueing processes become an important determinant for recall, such as when shared category information can be used as a retrieval aid to cue list items or plausible list candidates. </span><span class="sentence">In this case, the presence of categorically similar irrelevant items impairs the retrieval of list items and leads to intrusion error. </span><span class="sentence">Implications of these results for theories of auditory distraction are discussed.</span>
