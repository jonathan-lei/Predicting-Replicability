<span class="sentence">Episodic memory enables individuals to recollect past events as well as imagine possible future scenarios. </span><span class="sentence">Although the episodic specificity of past events declines as people grow older, it is unknown whether the same is true for future events. </span><span class="sentence">In an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview, young and older participants generated past and future events. </span><span class="sentence">Transcriptions were segmented into distinct details that were classified as either internal (episodic) or external. </span><span class="sentence">Older adults generated fewer internal details than younger adults for past events, a result replicating previous findings; more important, we show that this deficit extends to future events. </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, the number of internal details and the number of external details both showed correlations between past and future events. </span><span class="sentence">Finally, the number of internal details generated by older adults correlated with their relational memory abilities, a finding consistent with the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis, which holds that simulation of future episodes requires a system that can flexibly recombine details from past events into novel scenarios.</span>
