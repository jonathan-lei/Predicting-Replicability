<span class="sentence">      A sequential risk-taking paradigm used to identify real-world risk takers invokes both learning and decision processes. </span><span class="sentence">This article expands the paradigm to a larger class of tasks with different stochastic environments and different learning requirements. </span><span class="sentence">Generalizing a Bayesian sequential risk-taking model to the larger set of tasks clarifies the roles of learning and decision making during sequential risky choice. </span><span class="sentence">Results show that respondents adapt their learning processes and associated mental representations of the task to the stochastic environment. </span><span class="sentence">Furthermore, their Bayesian learning processes are shown to interfere with the paradigm's identification of risky drug use, whereas the decision-making process facilitates its diagnosticity. </span><span class="sentence">Theoretical implications of the results in terms of both understanding risk-taking behavior and improving risk-taking assessment methods are discussed.</span>
