<span class="sentence">Action control in a changing environment requires that one shield current goals from distracting information (goal shielding) and at the same time monitor the environment for potentially significant stimuli that may afford a goal switch (background monitoring). </span><span class="sentence">Response conflicts modulate the balance between goal shielding and background monitoring, as indicated by reduced susceptibility to interference after response conflicts. </span><span class="sentence">Such conflict-adaptation effects have been attributed to enhanced recruitment of cognitive control on trials following conflicts. </span><span class="sentence">Here we show that conflict triggers increased goal shielding on the conflict trial itself. </span><span class="sentence">Subjects performed a spatial compatibility task during which they had to notice rare prospective memory cues. </span><span class="sentence">Such cues were overlooked more often on conflict trials than on nonconflict trials, a result indicating that shielding of the current goal and inhibition of distractors were increased on the current trial when it involved a response conflict. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, evidence for enhanced recruitment of control following conflict may partly reflect aftereffects of goal shielding on the conflict trial itself.</span>
