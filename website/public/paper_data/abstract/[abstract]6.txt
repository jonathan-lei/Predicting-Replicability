<span class="sentence">      In this article, the authors explored the existence of across-notation automatic numerical processing using size comparison and same-different paradigms. </span><span class="sentence">Participants were Arabic speakers, who used 2 sets of numerical symbols -- Arabic and Indian. </span><span class="sentence">They were presented with number pairs in the same notation (Arabic or Indian) or in different ones (Arabic and Indian). </span><span class="sentence">In the size comparison paradigm, 2 digits differing both numerically and physically were compared on the physical dimension. </span><span class="sentence">Nevertheless, there was evidence that participants automatically processed the irrelevant numerical dimension in different notation pairs. </span><span class="sentence">In the same-different paradigm, 2 digits were presented either in the same or in different notations. </span><span class="sentence">Participants had to indicate whether the 2 digits were physically the same. </span><span class="sentence">The results again showed evidence for the automatic processing of numerical magnitude for pairs in different notations. </span><span class="sentence">Findings of both experiments suggest that numbers in different notations are automatically translated into a common representation of magnitude, in line with M. McCloskey's (1992) abstract representation model.</span>
