<span class="sentence">      Past research showed that considering a persuasive message in light of important rather than unimportant values creates attitudes that resist later attack. </span><span class="sentence">The traditional explanation is that the attitudes come to express the value or that a cognitive link between the value and attitude enhances resistance. </span><span class="sentence">However, the current research showed that another explanation is plausible. </span><span class="sentence">Similar to other sources of involvement, considering important rather than unimportant values increases processing of the message considered in light of those values. </span><span class="sentence">This occurs when the values are identified as normatively high or low in importance and when the perceived importance differs across participants for the same values. </span><span class="sentence">The increase in processing creates resistance to later attacks, and unlike past research, individual-level measures of initial amount of processing mediate value importance effects on later resistance to change. </span><span class="sentence">Important values motivate processing because they increase personal involvement with the issue, rather than creating attitudes that represent or express core values.</span>
