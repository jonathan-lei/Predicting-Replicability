<span class="sentence">      It has been claimed that bilingualism enhances inhibitory control, but the available evidence is equivocal. </span><span class="sentence">The authors evaluated several possible versions of the inhibition hypothesis by comparing monolinguals and bilinguals with regard to stop signal performance, inhibition of return, and the attentional blink. </span><span class="sentence">These three phenomena, it can be argued, tap into different aspects of inhibition. </span><span class="sentence">Monolinguals and bilinguals did not differ in stop signal reaction time and thus were comparable in terms of active-inhibitory efficiency. </span><span class="sentence">However, bilinguals showed no facilitation from spatial cues, showed a strong inhibition of return effect, and exhibited a more pronounced attentional blink. </span><span class="sentence">These results suggest that bilinguals do not differ from monolinguals in terms of active inhibition but have acquired a better ability to maintain action goals and to use them to bias goal-related information. </span><span class="sentence">Under some circumstances, this ability may indirectly lead to more pronounced reactive inhibition of irrelevant information.</span>
