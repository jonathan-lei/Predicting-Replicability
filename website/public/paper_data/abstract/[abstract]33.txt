<span class="sentence">      Three experiments with short-term recognition tasks are reported. </span><span class="sentence">In Experiments 1 and 2, participants decided whether a probe matched a list item specified by its spatial location. </span><span class="sentence">Items presented at study in a different location (intrusion probes) had to be rejected. </span><span class="sentence">Serial position curves of positive, new, and intrusion probes over the probed location's position were mostly parallel. </span><span class="sentence">Serial position curves of intrusion probes over their position of origin were again parallel to those of positive probes. </span><span class="sentence">Experiment 3 showed largely parallel serial position effects for positive probes and for intrusion probes plotted over positions in a relevant and an irrelevant list, respectively. </span><span class="sentence">The results support a dual-process theory in which recognition is based on familiarity and recollection, and recollection uses 2 retrieval routes, from context to item and from item to context.</span>
