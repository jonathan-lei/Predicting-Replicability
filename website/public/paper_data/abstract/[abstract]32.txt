<span class="sentence">      Given a changing visual environment, and the limited capacity of visual working memory (VWM), the contents of VWM must be in constant flux. </span><span class="sentence">Using a change detection task, the authors show that VWM is subject to obligatory updating in the face of new information. </span><span class="sentence">Change detection performance is enhanced when the item that may change is retrospectively cued 1 s after memory encoding and 0.5 s before testing. </span><span class="sentence">The retro-cue benefit cannot be explained by memory decay or by a reduction in interference from other items held in VWM. </span><span class="sentence">Rather, orienting attention to a single memory item makes VWM more resistant to interference from the test probe. </span><span class="sentence">The authors conclude that the content of VWM is volatile unless it receives focused attention, and that the standard change detection task underestimates VWM capacity.</span>
