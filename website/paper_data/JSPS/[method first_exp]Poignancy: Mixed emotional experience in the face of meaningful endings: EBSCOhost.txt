Younger participants received course credit or were paid $25 for their participation. Older participants were paid $25 for their participation. There were no significant differences between age groups in household income, <em>t</em>(107) = −0.02, <em>p</em> = .98. <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> depicts the descriptive statistics for participant information from Study 1.<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/bddf8628ac080f84ccdcd00dc050c118/5ebcb7f4/pdh/psp/psp-94-1-158-tbl1a.gif" alt="psp-94-1-158-tbl1a.gif" title="Participant Characteristic Information in Study 1" /><em>Participant Characteristic Information in Study 1</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">An IBM R-40 Thinkpad with E-Prime software (<a href="#c33">Schneider, Eschman, &amp; Zuccolotto, 2002</a>) was used for stimulus presentation and data acquisition. Participants completed a number of measures to assess demographic background variables, physical health, and cognitive abilities. Together, these measures provide descriptive information.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Wahler Physical Health Inventory (<a href="#c39">Wahler, 1973</a>)</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The Wahler Physical Health Inventory measures each participant's subjective interpretation of his or her physical health. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they are bothered by 42 different physical health symptoms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Wechsler Digit Span Test (<a href="#c40">Wechsler, 1997</a>)</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The Wechsler Digit Span Test requires participants to repeat a string of numbers forward and backward. Considered a test of short-term memory, it has been normed for older adults and correlates well with general intelligence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>F, A, S, and Category Naming Task (<a href="#c36">Spreen &amp; Benton, 1977</a>)</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Verbal fluency was assessed by asking participants to name as many “F,” “A,” and “S” words as they could in 60 s. Participants were then asked to name as many members of the category “animal” as they could in 60 s.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Experimental Procedures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants first read and signed a consent form and then completed a demographics questionnaire. To eliminate variation in the experimental induction, instructions for each scenario were recorded using iTunes software and were played for participants. Participants were seated in front of the computer and were instructed to do the following: “Think of a place that has personal significance to you. Please think of a specific, <strong data-auto="strong_text">meaningful</strong> location that you go to with people whom you care about.” After the participant had selected a <strong data-auto="strong_text">meaningful</strong> location, the experimenter recorded the location.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were then taken through three guided imagery induction trials. In the first trial, participants were given the following instructions:

<blockquote>Please close your eyes. Now please take a moment to imagine being at the location that you just described. As best you can, place yourself in the location. Notice your surroundings. Notice any people whom you are with, their faces, and voices. Take in everything that you see. Listen carefully to the sounds of your surroundings. Take a deep breath and notice the smells. Notice the air on your skin. Now take whatever time you need to fully experience the sights, sounds, and smells of the environment and the overall experience of the location. When you are ready, please open your eyes.</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Upon completing this induction, all participants completed an emotion questionnaire on the computer in which they rated the degree to which they were experiencing each of 19 different emotions (positive: accomplishment, amusement, contentment, excitement, happiness, interest, joy, and pride; negative: anger, anxiety, boredom, disgust, embarrassment, fear, frustration, guilt, irritation, sadness, and shame) on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 7 (<em>extremely</em>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second guided imagery induction trial immediately followed this emotion questionnaire and was identical to the first trial in all but one respect: In this trial, participants were asked to imagine the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experience</strong> of being at their favorite location as if they were there in 2 months' time. After this guided imagery induction, all participants completed the same emotion questionnaire again.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the third guided imagery induction, participants in the control condition were asked to imagine the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experience</strong> of being at their favorite location as if they were there in 4 months' time. Control participants then completed the emotion questionnaire for the final time. In the experimental limited-time condition, however, participants were asked to imagine the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experience</strong> of being at their favorite location as if they were there in 4 months' time and, importantly, as though this would be the last time that they would be able to visit the <strong data-auto="strong_text">meaningful</strong> location. After finishing the third trial, participants in the experimental condition then completed the emotion questionnaire for the final time. Thus, the experimental manipulation occurred during the third trial.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All participants then completed a series of tasks and questionnaires, composed of the Digit Span Test (<a href="#c40">Wechsler, 1997</a>), the Verbal Fluency task (<a href="#c36">Spreen &amp; Benton, 1977</a>), and the Wahler Physical Health Inventory (<a href="#c39">Wahler, 1973</a>).</p><a id="psp-94-1-158-ID0EACCAA"> </a>
