Undergraduate student participants assigned study time either to a core-course exam, to which their commitment is certain and relatively high, or to an elective-course exam, to which their commitment is uncertain and relatively low, after learning that they had covered (vs. had not yet covered) half the exam materials. We predicted that for an elective-course exam, emphasizing the progress to date (vs. to go) would increase the motivation to study, whereas for a core-course exam, emphasizing the remaining progress to go (vs. to date) would increase the motivation to study.</p><a id="psp-94-2-183-ID0EBGCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 92 University of Chicago undergraduate students (30 men, 62 women) who participated in the experiment for monetary compensation. The gender of participants did not yield any effects here or in subsequent studies; therefore, we omit gender from further consideration.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This study had a 2 (course: core vs. elective) × 2 (focus: to date vs. to go) between-subjects design. Participants completed a survey on academic goals. The first part of the survey asked all participants to consider a scenario in which they have two exams scheduled on the same day, a week from the present date, for different classes. Participants read that one exam was for a core course for which they would want to earn the best grade possible, whereas the other exam was for an elective course that they were taking pass/fail. These instructions emphasized the certain and relatively high commitment to the core-course (vs. elective-course) exam. The rest of the survey referred to only one of these exams, depending on the experimental condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To allow us to manipulate the focus on completed actions versus remaining actions, the survey included a chart representing the amount of materials that participants had presumably already covered (a to-date frame) or that they had yet to cover (a to-go frame) for their exam. The chart consisted of a bar containing an arrow. The bar represented the total amount of work toward goal attainment (100%), and the arrow represented the current level of performance, which was held at 48% across all conditions. We purposely chose a number close to the midpoint but different from 50%, which we assumed would be too easy for participants to reverse in their minds (e.g., framing 50% to date as 50% to go). By choosing a number close to the midpoint, we further controlled for a possible systematic difference in motivation as a function of emphasizing small and large areas. For example, 20% to go and 80% to date vary not only by focus but also by the size of the emphasized area.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the to-date condition, the arrow was colored from the starting point (0%) to the current level of progress (48%), and participants read that the arrow described the amount of materials they had already covered for their exam. In the to-go condition, the arrow was colored from the current level of performance (48%) to the end point (100%), and participants read that the arrow described the amount of materials they had yet to study for their exam.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, to measure motivation to study for the exam, participants indicated the amount of time they would spend studying for the exam (up to 20 hr) and the amount of effort they would put into studying (7-point scale; 1 = <em>not at all</em>, 7 = <em>very much</em>). To assess the effect of the manipulation on participants’ level of commitment, we asked them to further rate the importance of studying for the exam (7-point scale; 1 = <em>not important at all</em>, 7 = <em>very important</em>). Upon completion of the survey, participants were debriefed and dismissed by the experimenter.</p><a id="psp-94-2-183-ID0EAGCAA"> </a>
