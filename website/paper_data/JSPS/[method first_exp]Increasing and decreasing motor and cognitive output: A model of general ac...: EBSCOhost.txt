<h4>Experiment 1: Folding Paper Airplanes/Doodling Versus Resting</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Overview</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this experiment, participants first completed several word fragments to form a word. For about half of these participants, several of the completed words related to action. For the other half, the words related to inaction. Next, participants were asked to clear their minds by choosing either to fold or doodle on a piece of paper (active task) or to simply relax (inactive task). We predicted that participants primed with action would be more likely to choose the active, whereas participants primed with rest would be more likely to choose the inactive behavior. Importantly, the primes should produce these patterns of behavior because they activate action and inaction concepts and possibly concept-related goals. Therefore, prior to this experiment, we obtained evidence about concept activation using a lexical decision task. In another pretest, measures of mood were included to rule out the possibility that the primes had effects on positive and negative feelings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Participants and Design</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Ninety-eight male and female students attending the University of Florida participated in this experiment in return for partial course credit. Participants were randomly assigned to either an action-prime condition or an inaction-prime condition. The design was a two-cell between-subjects design. There were also two pretests performed on independent study samples.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Experimental Procedures</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were first told that they would complete several tasks within their experimental session. The first of these tasks ostensibly measured verbal ability and was designed to prime participants with an action or an inaction concept. After the priming, participants were given an actual choice between an active and inactive task. The choice was followed by several filler tasks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Action and inaction primes</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the beginning of this experiment, we explained that we needed to administer a quick measure of verbal ability. Participants were asked to complete 20 words, 8 of which connoted either “action” or “inaction.” Depending on random allocation, half of the participants received 8 incomplete rest-related words that could be completed as “still,” “pause,” “interrupt,” “calm,” “freeze,” “unable,” “stop,” and “paralyze,” whereas the other half received 8 action-related words that could be completed as “motivation,” “doing,” “behavior,” “engage,” “action,” “make,” “go,” and “active.” Most of these words had high associations with “action” and “rest” in the (empirically derived) Computerized Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (<a href="#c29">Kiss, Armstrong, Milroy, &amp; Piper, 1973</a>). Some critical pretests for the concept activation and potential effects on mood are detailed presently.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Choice of tasks</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After completing the priming task, participants were told to clear their minds before proceeding to other tasks. With this ostensible purpose, participants were given 2 min of rest for which they could choose one of two tasks. Specifically, participants read the following:

<blockquote>We will now give you two minutes to clear your mind. During this time, you should either: 1) remain seated and close your eyes for two minutes. During this time you should try to calmly relax and clear your mind, give your brain a break, or 2) do something with the scrap piece of paper you see at your computer station for two minutes. During this time you can doodle on the paper, fold it, or even make something like a paper airplane.</blockquote> The order of presentation of the active and inactive options was counterbalanced. After making their choice, participants learned that the computer would automatically proceed to the next screen after the 2 min had elapsed. After the 2-min period, participants were asked, “Did you remain seated with your eyes closed or did you do something with the piece of paper?,” and they responded by checking the box for either the number 1 (<em>I sat with my eyes closed</em>) or 2 (<em>I did something with the paper</em>). These responses were verified by observation on the part of a research assistant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Pretesting</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Two independent groups of 60 and 35 (men and women, respectively) participants were used to determine whether the word primes produced corresponding concept activation and to rule out possible mood effects. These participants were primed with action and inaction as in the main study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Concept activation check</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Following the word-completion manipulation, the first pretest (<em>N</em> = 60) entailed a lexical decision task in which 10 action words shown in the priming task (e.g., “active,” “go,” “move,” and “behavior”), 10 action words not shown in the priming task (e.g., “run,” “jump,” “hit,” and “build”), 10 previously shown inaction words (e.g., “stop,” “calm,” “freeze,” and “relax”), and 10 not-previously-shown inaction words (e.g., “dormant,” “sleep,” “rest,” and “serene”) were presented along with corresponding sets of 10 filler words (e.g., “day,” “wall,” “sponge,” and “lemonade”). The fillers were matched in word frequency, word length, and number of syllables to their respective critical words. A total of 60 nonwords (e.g., “bitavior,” “mobe,” srod,” and “cilt”) were also included.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The lexical decision task consisted of 10 critical blocks with six words from each word category and six nonwords per block. Before the critical blocks, one block of practice trials was run containing six neutral words (e.g., “television,” “apple,” and “this”) and six nonwords. Half of the participants were instructed to press the “9” key on the keyboard if they thought the stimulus on the screen was a word. Correspondingly, they were instructed to push the “1” key on the keyboard if they thought that the stimulus was a nonword. For the other half of the participants, the correspondence of the keys and words/nonwords was switched. (Order did not make a difference.) The participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Reaction times greater than 3,000 ms and less than 100 ms were trimmed, and words not correctly completed (over all words: <em>M</em> = 2.30%, <em>SD</em> = 2.34%, incorrect completions) were set as missing values (<a href="#c9">Bargh &amp; Chartrand, 2000</a>). Then, means and standard deviations of reaction times of all the words were calculated for each participant. The responses greater than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean for each participant were excluded (<a href="#c9">Bargh &amp; Chartrand, 2000</a>). After that, reaction times for each word set were averaged (<a href="#c9">Bargh &amp; Chartrand, 2000</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Checks for mood effects</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A separate group of students (<em>N</em> = 35) underwent the same manipulation procedures as the main study and then reported their affective feelings. Specifically, after the word-completion task, participants used 1 to 11 scales to indicate whether they felt <em>good</em> versus <em>bad</em>, <em>disappointed</em> versus <em>satisfied</em>, <em>sad</em> versus <em>happy</em>, and <em>displeased</em> versus <em>pleased</em>. Responses to these four scales were used as an index of feelings valence (α = .97).</p>
