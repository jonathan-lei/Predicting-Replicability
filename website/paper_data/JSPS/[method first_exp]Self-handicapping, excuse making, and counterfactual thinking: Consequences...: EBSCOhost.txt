Specifically, participants generated counterfactual thoughts following a midterm examination in their <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> course in which a lack of study effort could have served as a <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-handicap. Individuals reporting low preparatory effort for the course exam were expected to generate more upward counterfactual thoughts about their effort relative to those reporting high preparatory effort for the exam. Furthermore, controlling for reported effort, individuals were expected to experience higher <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem as a result of generating upward counterfactuals about a lack of effort. Given that past work has shown that upward counterfactuals involve a tradeoff of increased negative affect for increased preparative intentions and performance (<a href="#c37">Markman et al., 1993</a>; <a href="#c51">Myers &amp; McCrea, 2008</a>; <a href="#c57">Roese, 1994</a>), individuals using upward counterfactuals to <strong data-auto="strong_text">excuse</strong> a poor performance should experience less dissatisfaction and therefore be less motivated to improve in the future. Thus, individuals generating more upward counterfactuals about effort should report higher intentions to prepare in the future but only when these thoughts are accompanied by lower <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem. These effects of counterfactual thinking were expected to be limited to those specifically related to the handicap. Given that other counterfactuals are likely to mutate a mix of external and internal, stable and unstable factors, no predictions were made with regard to the effects of thoughts unrelated to the handicap for <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem or subsequent motivation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, attributions to effort were measured to assess whether effects of counterfactual thinking occurred independently of causal attribution. Based on previous research showing that counterfactual thinking and attribution are related but independent processes (<a href="#c35">Mandel, 2003</a>; <a href="#c36">Mandel &amp; Lehman, 1996</a>), it was predicted that effort attributions would show similar effects but would not account for the effects of counterfactuals concerning the handicap.</p><a id="psp-95-2-274-ID0ECFCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 125 (35 men, 90 women) Indiana University students in two sections of a <strong data-auto="strong_text">social</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> course who participated in return for extra credit in the course. There was no mention of <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">handicapping</strong> or counterfactual thought in either class. Both sections used the same text, the same test format, and the same timing of the test.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 1 involved three sessions, following the methods of <a href="#c44">McCrea and Hirt (2001)</a>. The first session occurred at the beginning of the semester. The second occurred approximately 1 week before a midterm exam in the course. The third occurred approximately 1 week after the exam, immediately after participants learned their score.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Session 1</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were told that the experimenters were interested in how students at large and small universities prepare for exams. They completed a detailed informed consent form and were assured their responses would be kept confidential, being identified only by a unique code. They were asked to complete a <strong data-auto="strong_text">personality</strong> profile that included <a href="#c63">Rosenberg's (1965)</a> <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem measure, answering on a 1 (<em>strongly agree</em>) to 7 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) scale.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Session 2</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were told that the researchers were interested in a number of factors, such as class size, that might influence how students prepare for tests. Participants were asked to complete several demographic measures, to provide their most recent GPA (high school or college) and college entrance exam scores (on a scale ranging from 1 = <em>&lt;600 SAT</em> or <em>&lt;18 ACT</em> to 10 = <em>1500–1600 SAT</em> or <em>34–36 ACT</em>), and to complete several items concerning the characteristics of their class and the instructor to solidify the cover story.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Session 3</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The final session occurred immediately after participants learned their score on the test. Participants indicated their score (percent correct) on the exam. They were then asked to list any thoughts they had about their test score. Thus, there were no explicit instructions concerning counterfactual thoughts. Participants then were asked whether their performance was due to their amount of effort, rated on a scale ranging from 1 (<em>disagree very much</em>) to 7 (<em>agree very much</em>), and completed a measure of mood and <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem. They indicated to what extent they felt each of 30 mood and <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem adjectives (adapted from <a href="#c47">McFarland &amp; Ross, 1982</a>) at that moment using a 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 7 (<em>very much</em>) scale.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">They next indicated how much effort they had put into studying for the exam (see also <a href="#c44">McCrea &amp; Hirt, 2001</a>). Participants completed measures assessing how much they had read the textbook, attended office hours, went to review sessions, used flash cards, asked the instructor questions, and asked other students questions. They responded to these items using a 0 (<em>not at all</em>) to 6 (<em>great deal</em>) scale. They also indicated how hard they had studied overall on a 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 7 (<em>very much</em>) scale and reported how many days before the exam they had studied. Finally, participants reported their intentions to study for the next exam in the class using the same items. At the end of the final session, the full purpose of the experiment, reason for the use of deception, and expected results were discussed with participants. The confidentiality of their responses was again stressed.</p><a id="psp-95-2-274-ID0EBFCAA"> </a>
