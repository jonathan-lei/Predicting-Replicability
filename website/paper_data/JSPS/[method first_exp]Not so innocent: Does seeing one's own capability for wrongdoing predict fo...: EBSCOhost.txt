Because generalizability concerns were particularly important to us in this initial study, we used two samples to test our hypothesis: an undergraduate sample and a more diverse Internet-based sample.</p><a id="psp-94-3-495-ID0EBICAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Sample 1: Undergraduates</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were 148 introductory <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> students (80 men, 68 women) at a private university in the Midwestern United States. All received partial course credit for completing a survey. The average age was 19 years, and all participants were single. The sample was predominantly Caucasian (71%) and Asian (16%).<a id="b-fn1"> </a><sup><a href="#fn1" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Sample 2: Internet</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants in the Internet sample (25 men, 81 women) took a Web-based version of the survey. We sent a recruitment e-mail to a broad spectrum of individuals, including instructors teaching <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> courses, colleagues, and acquaintances. After assuring them that all information would be kept confidential, we invited them to participate and/or to send the recruitment e-mail to others. The final sample was composed of an approximately equal number of college students (<em>n</em> = 56; 49% of sample) and nonstudents (<em>n</em> = 59). The mean age was 25.4 (<em>SD</em> = 8.9), and the majority (91%) of participants were from the United States. The sample was predominantly Caucasian (85%) and African American (11%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Following established procedures (e.g., <a href="#c11">Boon &amp; Sulsky, 1997</a>; <a href="#c16">Darby &amp; Schlenker, 1982</a>; <a href="#c78">Zechmeister &amp; Romero, 2002</a>), participants were asked to recall two situations in which someone had hurt or offended them: one in which they forgave and another in which they did not forgive. The two conditions were counterbalanced to control for order effects. No specific definition of forgiveness was provided. Instead, participants drew on their own ideas about what forgiveness entailed. After describing the situation, participants completed the following measures.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Extent of forgiveness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a manipulation check, participants were asked, “To what extent have you forgiven this person?” (1 = <em>not at all</em>, 6 = <em>totally</em>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Capability for similar offense</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were asked, “Given the right circumstances, could you see yourself committing a similar offense to what happened to you (i.e., just as wrong or damaging)?” (1 = <em>no, not at all</em>, 6 = <em>yes, definitely</em>).</p><a id="psp-94-3-495-ID0EAICAA"> </a>
