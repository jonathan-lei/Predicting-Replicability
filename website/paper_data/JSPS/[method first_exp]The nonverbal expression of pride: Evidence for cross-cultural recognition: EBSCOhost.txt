Interested individuals were told that they must have been born and raised in Italy, and must not be able to speak or understand English. The study was conducted at the research institution by an Italian psychologist.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Four targets, a male and female Asian-American and a male and female Caucasian American (age range = 22–32 years) posed the <strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">expression</strong> shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> as well as expressions of contempt, happiness, and surprise. All photos were taken from the waist up. Targets wore identical white shirts and posed in front of a plain blue background. Posing instructions were based on the Directed Facial Action task (DFA; <a href="#c21">Ekman, Levenson, &amp; Friesen, 1983</a>) for all emotions other than <strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong>. Posing instructions for <strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong> were based on previous research on the <strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">expression</strong> (<a href="#c71">Tracy &amp; Robins, 2004b</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were seated in front of a laptop computer and were shown each photo on the 14-inch (35.56-cm) monitor for 30 s. For each photo, participants were asked to choose the emotion that “best matches the emotion expressed by the person in the photo” from the following options: <em>contempt</em> (<em>disprezzo</em>), <em>boredom</em>(<em>noia</em>), <em>excitement</em>(<em>eccitazione</em>), <em>happiness</em>(<em>gioia</em> and <em>felicità</em>), <em><strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong></em>(<em>fierezza</em> and <em>orgoglio</em>), <em>surprise</em> (<em>sorpresa</em>), <em>none of these is correct</em> (<em>nessuna di queste emozioni descrive correttamenta la fotografia</em>), and <em>other:</em> ___ (<em>altro: si prega di specificare</em> ___). <em>Boredom</em> and <em>excitement</em> were included because these words are rarely but occasionally applied to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">expression</strong> in open-ended recognition studies of <strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong> (<a href="#c71">Tracy &amp; Robins, 2004b</a>). The <em>none of these is correct</em> option was included because it has been shown to address concerns associated with the standard forced-choice format (<a href="#c24">Frank &amp; Stennett, 2001</a>). Specifically, participants will use this option to label nonsense expressions that have no known emotion word label and to label known expressions when the correct emotion word is not provided. The <em>other</em> option was included to allow participants to respond in an open-ended manner, to further address concerns associated with the forced-choice format (<a href="#c51">Matsumoto et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#c61">Russell, 1994</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The rating form was translated into Italian by a bilingual Italian psychologist and was independently confirmed by back-translating the response options using an Italian–English dictionary (<a href="#c13">Dizionari Garzanti, 1997</a>). <strong data-auto="strong_text">Pride</strong> has two translations in the Italian language, <em>fierezza</em> and <em>orgoglio</em>, and both were included as options.<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup> To avoid drawing attention to <strong data-auto="strong_text">pride</strong>, two translations for happiness, <em>felicità</em> and <em>gioia</em>, were also included.</p><a id="psp-94-3-516-ID0EAECAA"> </a>
