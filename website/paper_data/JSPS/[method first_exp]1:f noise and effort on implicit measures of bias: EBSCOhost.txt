During the experimental session, each participant performed a shoot/don't-shoot video game task, which presented Black and White targets who were either armed or unarmed. The goal of this task was to shoot all armed targets but to indicate <em>don't shoot</em> for all unarmed targets. Participants also completed a modified version of a <a href="#c27">Stroop (1935)</a> task, described below, which was included to allow the examination of discriminant validity. This second task helps determine whether results on the video game are specific to that measure or, instead, emerge in any reaction-time task. The results reported by <a href="#c3">Clayton and Frey (1997)</a> suggest that more challenging tasks reduce 1/<em>f</em> <strong data-auto="strong_text">noise</strong>, but it is not clear what drives this effect. Task-relevant <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong> and perceived task difficulty might both be associated with reductions in 1/<em>f</em> <strong data-auto="strong_text">noise</strong> in the video game. On completion of both tasks, participants therefore reported the degree to which they tried to avoid biased behavior in the video game task (<em>rated <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong></em>) and the degree to which the task was perceived as difficult (<em>rated difficulty</em>). The study followed a 2 (target race: Black vs. White) × 2 (object type: gun vs. nongun) within-participants design, with rated <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong> and rated difficulty measured continuously as between-participants factors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Video game</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This study used a simple video game task (for details, see <a href="#c4">Correll et al., 2002</a>). As implemented in Study 1, the task consisted of 200 trials in which participants were asked to respond to an image of a young man (i.e., a target). One hundred trials presented a Black target; 100 trials presented a White target. Within each race, half of the targets held pistols and half held innocuous objects (e.g., cell phones or wallets). Fifty targets, then, appeared in each of the four cells defined by the 2 × 2 repeated-<strong data-auto="strong_text">measures</strong> design: unarmed White, unarmed Black, armed White, armed Black. Participants were instructed to press a button labeled <em>shoot</em> if the target was armed but to press a separate button labeled <em>don't shoot</em> for any unarmed targets. This task typically imposes a response window of 850 ms, but to avoid missing data (which is problematic for Fourier analysis), this response deadline was eliminated in the present study. A 500-ms intertrial interval preceded each trial. A 16-trial practice round preceded the test phase.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Stroop task</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The modified Stroop task involved a series of trials on which a fixation cross (500 ms) appeared on the computer screen, followed by a simple letter string (<em>xxxx</em>) in one of four colors: red, green, blue, or yellow. Participants were asked to categorize the color of the typeface by pressing one of four color-designated keys. The task began with a 40-trial block of practice trials after which participants were asked to contact the experimenter if they had any questions. After the experimenter addressed any questions, participants pressed the space bar to resume the task, which started with 10 buffer trials prior to a 200-trial test block. A 1,000-ms intertrial interval preceded each trial.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Questionnaire</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After the computer tasks, participants completed a short questionnaire, which included questions assessing demographics, <strong data-auto="strong_text">measures</strong> of prejudice, and two critical questions. The first question (rated <strong data-auto="strong_text">effort</strong>) simply asked, with reference to the video game task, “How hard did you try to avoid showing racial <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong>?” Response options ranged from 1 (<em>I didn't try at all</em>) to 9 (<em>I tried very hard</em>). The second question (rated difficulty) also referred to the video game task: “How difficult was the task?” Response options ranged from 1 (<em>not at all difficult</em>) to 9 (<em>very difficult</em>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A White female research assistant met participants individually and introduced the shoot/don't-shoot and Stroop tasks as tests of vigilance. After the tasks, participants completed the questionnaire. They were then thanked and debriefed.</p><a id="psp-94-1-48-ID0EACCAA"> </a>
