Participants made a decision on a legal case study. Afterward, they selected 1 piece of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> among either 2 or 10 pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> (half consistent and half inconsistent). Participants in the condition with 2 pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> were expected to systematically prefer inconsistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> and thus replicate the classic findings of the <a href="#c14">Freedman (1965)</a> and <a href="#c40">Sears (1965)</a> studies (cf. <a href="#c15">Freedman &amp; Sears, 1965</a>). In contrast, participants in the condition with 10 pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> were expected to significantly prefer consistent <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> and thus replicate the typical findings of recent research on <strong data-auto="strong_text">selective</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">exposure</strong> (cf. <a href="#c13">Fischer et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#c19">Frey, 1986</a>; <a href="#c26">Jonas et al., 2001</a>).</p><a id="psp-94-2-231-ID0EBECAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Sixty-four students (38 women and 26 men, 16 to 32 years of age) from a high school in Kiel and the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich (both cities located in Germany) participated in this experiment. It was a one-factorial design with two experimental conditions (2 pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> vs. 10 pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>) for the factor <strong data-auto="strong_text">Information</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">Quantity</strong>, with the direction of the selected <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> (consistent vs. inconsistent) as the dependent variable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In order to keep our experimental material as close as possible to the material used by <a href="#c40">Sears (1965)</a> and <a href="#c14">Freedman (1965)</a>, participants were confronted with a legal decision case that was slightly adapted to the German legal system. The decision case contained a hearing of evidence concerning the death of Mr. Schulz, a 19-year-old insurance broker, who lived with his father. Mr. Schulz’s father was unemployed, which contributed to the violent climate within the family: Fights between father and son were common. In a recent fight, Mr. Schulz succumbed to a fatal knife wound. The father then faced court charged with murder. However, it was unclear whether the son’s death was murder or manslaughter. Unfortunately, the only possible eyewitness—Mr. Schulz’s mother—had been struck on the head during the fight and was thus unconscious for most of it. Evidence procured from the scene of the incident was ambiguous.<a id="b-fn2"> </a><sup><a href="#fn2" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After participants had read the legal case study, they finally decided whether Mr. Schulz was murdered by his father or not. Afterward, participants were informed that either 2 or 10 pieces of additional <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> concerning the court proceeding were available. Each piece of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> was characterized by a main thesis containing <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> direction (i.e., whether they were consistent or inconsistent with the prior decision) and a short explanation. Participants learned that these main theses represented one full page of more detailed statements and were appraisals by legal experts who were familiar with the court proceedings. An example of a piece of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> implying that the father killed Mr. Schulz is as follows: “Mr. Schulz fought with his father on numerous occasions. This should be evidence enough of the guilt of the father.” An example assuming the innocence of the father is as follows: “We have no fingerprints on the knife and no witnesses. Without such evidence, Mr. Schulz’s father should be released.” In both conditions, half of the statements spoke for and half spoke against a conviction of Mr. Schulz. Hence, irrespective of the participants’ previous decision, half of the pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> were consistent and half were inconsistent with this decision. The participants could select only 1 piece of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>—either a consistent or an inconsistent one. Please note that this instruction to select only 1 piece of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> is very important and necessary to keep <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong>-search conditions comparable, otherwise (under conditions of free choice) <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> search (i.e., number of pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> that could be selected) and <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">quantity</strong> (number of pieces of <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> to which participants are exposed) would be confounded. After <strong data-auto="strong_text">information</strong> selection, the experiment ended and participants were debriefed, thanked for their participation, and dismissed.</p><a id="psp-94-2-231-ID0EAECAA"> </a>
