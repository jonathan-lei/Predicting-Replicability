To create groups that were highly representative of these profiles, we recruited participants with IMS and EMS scores in the upper or lower thirds of the participant pool (<a href="#c1">Alloy, Abramson, Raniere, &amp; Dyller, 1999</a>; <a href="#c5">Amodio et al., 2003</a>). The extreme-groups approach was critical for obtaining a true low-IMS group, because IMS scores were highly positively skewed in this sample. In addition, we combined low-IMS participants who reported either high or low levels of EMS, because their responses, which were to be made in private (i.e., without external pressures), were not theorized to differ (<a href="#c5">Amodio et al., 2003</a>; <a href="#c27">Devine et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#c57">Plant &amp; Devine, 1998</a>). We predicted that high-IMS/low-EMS and high-IMS/high-EMS participants would report similar pro-Black attitudes, yet high-IMS/low-EMS participants would exhibit greater response control on the weapons-identification task relative to high-IMS/high-EMS participants. Furthermore, we predicted that this <strong data-auto="strong_text">difference</strong> would be explained by the degree of conflict-monitoring activity during responses in which automatic stereotypes conflicted with intentions. We expected to observe relatively low activity of the conflict-monitoring process among high-IMS/high-EMS participants when automatic stereotypes are activated, because their egalitarian intentions are not believed to be represented at the same automatic level of processing and thus would not create conflict. Last, low-IMS participants were expected to show a low degree of response control, coupled with low engagement of conflict-monitoring processes on stereotype-related trials. A low degree of conflict was expected because stereotypic responses are consistent with their prejudiced beliefs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To conduct a strong test of our hypothesis, it was important to use a task that would elicit similar levels of automatic race-biased tendencies across groups. Our past work showed that high-IMS/low-EMS participants exhibited lower levels of implicit <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong> than other groups on measures assessing affective/evaluative forms of <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong> (<a href="#c5">Amodio et al., 2003</a>; <a href="#c27">Devine et al., 2002</a>). However, high-IMS/low-EMS participants did not differ from other participants when implicit stereotype associations were measured (<a href="#c8">Amodio, Stahlhut, &amp; Devine, 2002</a>). This distinction is consistent with research suggesting that implicit stereotyping reflects different underlying neurocognitive mechanisms than do affect-driven forms of implicit <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong> (<a href="#c3">Amodio &amp; Devine, 2006</a>). Because the weapons identification task elicits response biases that are driven primarily by stereotype associations rather than by affective responses, it was particularly well-suited for testing our hypothesis (<a href="#c41">Judd, Blair, &amp; Champleau, 2004</a>). In addition, we chose to focus on PD estimates of automaticity and control as our primary behavioral outcomes. Although reaction times and error rates have been used to indicate automatic and controlled response patterns in much past work, it is likely that any given response involves some combination of automatic and controlled processes, and thus raw measures of reaction time and accuracy do not provide process-pure indicators of automaticity and control (<a href="#c40">Jacoby, 1991</a>). The validity of the PD procedure in the context of prejudice has been established in several published articles (e.g., <a href="#c6">Amodio et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#c41">Judd et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#c56">Payne et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#c45">Lambert et al., 2003</a>), and the assumption of independent processes for automaticity and control is consistent with research identifying their separate neural substrates (e.g., <a href="#c6">Amodio et al., 2004</a>, <a href="#c7">2006</a>; <a href="#c21">Cunningham et al., 2004</a>).</p><a id="psp-94-1-60-ID0ECCCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Seventy-three <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> students at the University of Wisconsin—Madison participated individually in exchange for extra course credit. We selected right-handed female participants to control for variability in physiological responses associated with sex and handedness (<a href="#c38">Heller &amp; Levy, 1981</a>). Participants were White Americans, except for one Asian American.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After they provided consent, participants were prepared for physiological recording and were given instructions for the weapons identification task. They were told that certain responses (i.e., errors on Black–tool trials) would reveal race <strong data-auto="strong_text">bias</strong> but that their responses would be private and confidential. These instructions were designed to activate any internal motivations to respond without prejudice while minimizing concerns over external pressures to appear nonprejudiced (as in <a href="#c6">Amodio et al., 2004</a>). After completing the task, participants received a funneled debriefing and were thanked, awarded extra credit, and dismissed. Sessions took approximately 2.5 hr.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>IMS and EMS</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants completed <a href="#c57">Plant and Devine's (1998)</a> IMS (α = .84) and EMS (α = .89) confidentially in a previous mass testing session. Responses ranged from 1 (<em>strongly disagree</em>) to 9 (<em>strongly agree</em>). The IMS includes items such as “I attempt to act in nonprejudiced ways toward Black people because it is personally important to me.” The EMS includes items such as “I attempt to appear nonprejudiced toward Black people in order to avoid disapproval from others.” <a href="#c57">Plant and Devine (1998)</a> found scores on the IMS and EMS to be independent across seven samples (average <em>r</em> = −.14), and therefore, <strong data-auto="strong_text">individuals</strong> with similar degrees of internal motivation can vary in their external motivations (<a href="#c5">Amodio et al., 2003</a>; <a href="#c27">Devine et al, 2002</a>; <a href="#c57">Plant &amp; Devine, 1998</a>; <a href="#c58">Plant, Devine, &amp; Brazy, 2003</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Attitude Towards Blacks (ATB) scale</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants completed the ATB scale (α = .87) in the same mass testing session. The ATB scale (<a href="#c16">Brigham, 1993</a>) assesses positivity of attitudes toward Black people, scored on a 1–7 scale on which higher scores indicate more positive attitudes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Weapons identification task</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stimuli and instructions were taken from <a href="#c6">Amodio et al. (2004</a>; originally adapted from <a href="#c54">Payne, 2001</a>). Stimuli included pictures of two Black and two White male faces, four handguns, and four hand tools (drill, ratchet, wrench, pliers), digitized at 228 × 172 pixels. Stimuli were presented sequentially in the center of the computer screen, and trial order was randomized. Each trial began with a cross-hatched pattern mask (1 s), followed by the prime (Black or White face; 200 ms), the target (gun or tool; 200 ms), and then a second pattern mask (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Participants were instructed to classify targets as guns or tools as quickly and accurately as possible using buttons labeled “gun” and “tool.” The second mask remained onscreen until the participant responded or until 2 s had elapsed. Participants received a warning to respond more quickly following responses exceeding 500 ms. Reaction times for all responses were recorded, even when they exceeded the deadline. Intertrial intervals ranged from 2.5 s to 4 s. Participants were seated 4 feet (1.22 m) from a 19-in. (48.26-cm) CRT monitor refreshing at 100 Hz. Stimuli and physiological recording triggers were presented with DMDX (<a href="#c33">Forster &amp; Forster, 2003</a>).<br /><br /><a id="fig1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/a786f6e31a3a4012fa2e267cf27c4910/5ebcb7de/pdh/psp/psp-94-1-60-fig1a.gif" alt="psp-94-1-60-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

Participants then completed 288 experimental trials, receiving a 2-min break after 144 trials. Accuracy feedback was given on practice trials but not on experimental trials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Behavioral-Data Processing</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Correct response latencies occurring between 250 ms and 1,500 ms were natural-log transformed and averaged within trial type for analysis (mean latencies are presented in raw ms). Because response-deadline feedback was displayed only after a response was made, response-latency data were not contaminated by the presentation of the warning message. We therefore included response latencies exceeding 500 ms in our analyses to avoid a restricted range of data known to attenuate response-latency effects (<a href="#c6">Amodio et al., 2004</a>, <a href="#c7">2006</a>; <a href="#c54">Payne, 2001</a>). Error rates were computed by dividing the number of errors by the total number of trials within each trial type.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The PD estimate of control was computed by subtracting participants' error rates on Black–tool trials from their accuracy rates on Black–gun trials (see <a href="#c54">Payne, 2001</a>). The PD estimate of automaticity was computed by dividing participants' error rates on Black–tool trials by the reciprocal of their control-estimate scores.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>EEG Recording and Processing</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">EEG was recorded from 27 tin electrodes embedded in a stretch-lycra cap (ElectroCap; Eaton, OH), which we positioned according to the 10-10 system using known anatomical landmarks. We referenced scalp electrodes online to the left earlobe (referenced to average earlobes offline), with a forehead ground, using Electro-Gel (Eaton, OH) as the conducting medium. All impedances were below 5 kΩ. Vertical and horizontal eye movements were recorded to facilitate artifact scoring of the EEG. Signals were amplified with Neuroscan Synamps (Sterling, VA) with a direct-current coupling, low-pass filtered at 100 Hz, digitized at 2,500 Hz, and stored to a computer hard drive.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Offline, EEG was scored for movement artifact, submitted to a regression-based blink-correction procedure (<a href="#c61">Semlitsch, Anderer, Schuster, &amp; Presslich, 1986</a>), and then submitted to a 1–15 Hz bandpass filter (96 dB, zero-phase shift). To quantify ERN amplitudes, we selected an 800-ms response-locked epoch of EEG signal for each artifact-free trial associated with a valid reaction time (250–1500 ms), to exclude ERNs associated with impulsive errors or inattentiveness. Baseline correction procedures subtracted the average voltage occurring from 400–50 ms preresponse from each entire epoch. Waveforms derived from correct and incorrect trials were then averaged within their respective trial types. On the basis of past work and visual inspection of waveforms, ERN amplitudes were scored as the peak negative deflection occurring between −50 ms and 150 ms at the frontocentral site (Fcz).</p><a id="psp-94-1-60-ID0EBCCAA"> </a>
