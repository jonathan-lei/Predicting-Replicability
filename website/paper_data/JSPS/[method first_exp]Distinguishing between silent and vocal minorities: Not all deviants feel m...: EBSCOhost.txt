<h4>Study 1</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 1 experimentally tested the hypothesis that people are more comfortable expressing descriptive deviant opinions than nondeviant or prescriptive deviant opinions. This was accomplished by randomly assigning participants to imagine that they had to argue in support of a descriptive deviant, nondeviant, or prescriptive deviant position on an issue and then measuring their comfort in doing so. In addition, four potential mediators were included. One of these assessed participants' perceptions of the desirability of the two forms of deviance, thereby permitting a direct test of the mediational claim that descriptive deviants are more comfortable because they know that their opinions render them superior conformists (i.e., different from their peers in a “good” way). The other three measures were included to permit tests of alternative explanations. These questions asked how well liked and popular participants believed their assigned position would make them, how similar they believed their assigned position was to that of their peers, and how much they believed their assigned position made them different from their peers in a “bad” way. To the extent that descriptive deviants' greater comfort was driven by their perception of superior conformity, we would not have expected their greater comfort to depend on their perception that they were more positively evaluated or closer to the average group opinion than were other group members.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Participants</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One hundred and thirty-six Stanford students (57 men, 77 women, 2 unspecified) participated in this questionnaire experiment as part of a 1-hr-long mass testing session. They were paid $20 upon completion of the entire session.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Materials and procedure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The questionnaire consisted of two pages. On the first page, participants were asked to imagine being required to deliver a speech to another student advocating a position on one of the three issues used in the pretest. The assigned position was that of a descriptive deviant (<em>much too low</em> for wages, <em>strongly in favor</em> for ethnic-theme dormitories and affirmative action), a nondeviant (<em>a little too low</em> for wages, s<em>lightly in favor</em> for ethnic-theme dormitories and affirmative action), or a prescriptive deviant (<em>much too high</em> for wages, s<em>trongly opposed</em> for ethnic-theme dormitories and affirmative action). Participants were further instructed to imagine that the other student believed that the position they took in their speech was their true attitude.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After reading the scenario, participants indicated how comfortable and nervous they would feel delivering the speech (1 = <em>not at all</em>, 9 = <em>very much</em>). Responses to the two items were averaged (and the nervousness item was reverse coded) to form a composite (<em>r</em> = .32, <em>p</em> &lt; .001). Finally, participants responded to several questions about their assigned position, also on a scale from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 9 (<em>very much</em>). Specifically, they indicated the extent to which actually holding their assigned position would make them similar to their peers (similarity), different from their peers in a good way (superior conformity), and different from their peers in a bad way (different but bad). They also indicated the extent to which actually holding their assigned position would make them well liked by and popular among their peers. These two items were averaged to form a liking index (<em>r</em> = .75, <em>p</em> &lt; .001).</p>
