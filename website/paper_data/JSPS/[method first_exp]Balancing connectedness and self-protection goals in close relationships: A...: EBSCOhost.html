We manipulated the perceived risks inherent in the external interpersonal world by asking participants to describe a time when a significant other hurt or disappointed them. We then measured <strong data-auto="strong_text">goal</strong> activation using a lexical decision task. Using this implicit measure allowed us to see whether risk primes <strong data-auto="strong_text">connectedness</strong> without people's conscious awareness or control. As active <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> increase the cognitive accessibility of <strong data-auto="strong_text">goal</strong>-relevant information (<a href="#c1">Aarts, Dijksterhuis, &amp; De Vries, 2001</a>; <a href="#c79">Shah, Friedman, &amp; Kruglanski, 2002</a>), we expected high and even low <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem participants primed with risk to identify words associated with seeking connection more quickly. We did not expect to see as strong evidence of <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">protection</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">goal</strong> activation on this task because risks external to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">relationship</strong> activate <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">protection</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> primarily indirectly, through the activation of <strong data-auto="strong_text">connectedness</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> (Path C).</p><a id="psp-94-3-429-ID0ECICAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Ninety-four undergraduates who were native English speakers and currently involved in exclusive dating <strong data-auto="strong_text">relationships</strong> participated in exchange for credit in their introductory <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> class. Six participants were eliminated for failing to follow instructions for the autobiographical recall task and for being extreme outliers on age, leaving a total sample of 89 (61 men). Participants were 19.1 years old on average (<em>SD</em> = 1.47), and they were in <strong data-auto="strong_text">relationships</strong> averaging 13.9 months (<em>SD</em> = 12.2) in length.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">On arrival at the laboratory, participants were told that the experiment examined interpersonal life experiences. All participants then completed a short background questionnaire that included basic demographic questions (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, fluency in English) and the <a href="#c75">Rosenberg (1965)</a> <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-esteem scale. Participants randomly assigned to the <em>general interpersonal risk</em> or experimental condition then provided a written description of a time when they felt intensely disappointed, hurt, or let down by someone <strong data-auto="strong_text">close</strong> to them. Participants were instructed to describe both what happened and how they felt about the experience at the time in detail. Participants indicated these episodes involved good friends (14%), best friends (20%), family members (16%), past romantic partners (32%), or the current romantic partner (14%).<a id="b-fn4"> </a><sup><a href="#fn4" /></sup> Participants in the control condition described their commute to campus.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All participants then completed the lexical decision task. Participants were seated in front of a computer and were instructed to indicate whether each target stimulus that appeared was a word or a nonword (by pressing the appropriate key). Participants were encouraged to respond as quickly as they could without making errors. The task contained 250 trials (125 words and 125 nonwords). The target words fell into three categories: (a) 32 words tapping <strong data-auto="strong_text">connectedness</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> (e.g., <em>vow, hug, kiss, join, want, grow, hope, rely, faith, trust</em>), (b) 10 words tapping <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">protection</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> (e.g., <em>retreat, protect, defense, caution, careful, prevent, watchful</em>), and (c) 25 words tapping hostility (e.g., <em>oppose, condemn, angry, blame, hate, annoy, accuse</em>). (We included the hostility words to provide an implicit measure of threat severity.) To distinguish the activation of <strong data-auto="strong_text">connectedness</strong> (or <strong data-auto="strong_text">self</strong>-<strong data-auto="strong_text">protection</strong>) <strong data-auto="strong_text">goals</strong> from the activation of positive or negative affect, we also included 15 positive and 15 negative noninterpersonal words (i.e., examples of fruits and insects, respectively). The remaining words were fillers. We created the nonwords by changing the last letter of a word matched in length to each target word in a way that turned it into a nonword. The words and nonwords were presented randomly, and reaction times (in milliseconds) were recorded. Participants then completed some filler measures and a manipulation check assessing feelings of interpersonal vulnerability. All participants were then probed for suspicion, debriefed, and thanked for their participation.<a id="b-fn5"> </a><sup><a href="#fn5" /></sup></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Interpersonal vulnerability</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This 13-item measure (Î± = .90) asked participants to indicate how recalling the episode made them feel now (e.g., happy, angry, hurt, betrayed, included, rejected, disappointed). Participants responded on 7-point scales (1 = <em>not at all</em>, 7 = <em>very</em>). Positive items were reverse-scored in computing the overall score such that higher scores reflected greater feelings of interpersonal angst or vulnerability.</p><a id="psp-94-3-429-ID0EBICAA"> </a>
