<h3>Experiment 3 (Attentional Blink)</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The major obstacle to experimental discrimination between active and reactive inhibition is that the mechanisms can commonly be suspected to serve the same purpose: that is, to suppress unwanted information. </button><button class="sentence">This is true for the Simon task (Bialystok, 2006; Bialystok et al., 2004, 2005), where the aim of both active and reactive inhibitory mechanisms would be to suppress the often misleading (and task-irrelevant) stimulus location, and for the cuing task used in our Experiment 2, where it was just as reasonable to suppress the randomly varying cue location. </button><button class="sentence">To circumvent this logical problem, we thought of an experimental task in which active inhibition makes little sense but reactive inhibition is nevertheless likely to occur. </button><button class="sentence">According to our reasoning, tasks producing the so-called attentional blink (AB; Raymond, Shapiro, &amp; Arnell, 1992) meet these criteria.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The AB occurs when two masked (or otherwise difficult to identify) target stimuli appear in close temporal proximity, such as in RSVP (rapid serial visual presentation) tasks with varying lags between the two targets. </button><button class="sentence">If the first target (T1) is identified correctly, people have great difficulty in reporting the second target (T2) when it occurs within an interval of about 100–500 ms after T1. </button><button class="sentence">Despite minor (often rather metaphorically expressed) details, most of the available approaches assume that processing and consolidating T1 occupies attentional mechanisms to a degree that means too little attention is left for processing and consolidating T2 if it appears before the consolidation of T1 is complete (for an overview, see Shapiro, 2001). </button><button class="sentence">However, recent observations are inconsistent with the assumption of a structural bottleneck (Colzato, Spapè, Pannebakker, &amp; Hommel, 2007; Di Lollo, Kawahara, Ghorashi, &amp; Enns, 2005; Hommel et al., 2006). </button><button class="sentence">For instance, people can report more than two targets when these targets are presented in a sequence (Di Lollo et al., 2005), which suggests that it is the presence of distractors between two given targets that is responsible for the blink. </button><button class="sentence">Hence, at least part of the AB seems to represent a side effect of a mechanism that shields targets against the impact of distractors, as does the mechanism sketched in Figure 1. Indeed, Shapiro, Schmitz, Martens, Hommel, and Schnitzler (2006) observed a trade-off between the amount of resources devoted to T1 processing and the probability of missing T2. </button><button class="sentence">In particular, participants who showed more attention-related brain activity while processing T1 were more likely to fail to report T2 in the blink interval. </button><button class="sentence">This finding fits with the observation that a more relaxed attitude toward the task improves performance on T2 (Olivers &amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2005). </button><button class="sentence">It is also consistent with the finding that successful report of T2 in the interval that typically produces a blink is accompanied by a dramatic suppression of brain responses to the distractors that intervene between T1 and T2 (Gross et al., 2004). </button><button class="sentence">In other words, the AB reflects the efficiency of noise suppression. </button><button class="sentence">Taken altogether, these studies suggest that people differ in the amount of attention they devote to the processing of a selected target stimulus and that this difference directly translates into their ability or inability to process a temporally close stimulus.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Getting back to our main question, these findings mean that people can indeed be suspected to differ with respect to how much support they provide for a to-be-selected stimulus event and/or how much reactive inhibition this support exerts on competitors (Routes a and b in Figure 1). </button><button class="sentence">This support would vary even under conditions in which the competitor is also a target, a fact that renders the presence of active inhibition (Route c) implausible. </button><button class="sentence">If so, we would be in the position of making a counterintuitive and rather surprising prediction: To the degree that they produce stronger reactive inhibition, bilinguals should exhibit worse performance (that is, a greater blink) in the AB task than monolinguals should. </button><button class="sentence">We tested this prediction by comparing performance of bilinguals and monolinguals in a standard RSVP task with two target stimuli.</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">We recruited 18 volunteers for each of the two language groups by applying the criteria and matching procedures used in Experiment 1 (see Tables 1 and 2). </button><button class="sentence">The balanced bilingual group comprised 12 bilingual participants from Experiment 1 and 6 additional Dutch–English bilinguals. </button><button class="sentence">The monolingual group comprised 18 new participants. </button><button class="sentence">Three monolingual participants were excluded from the analysis because of excessive error rates (&gt;80%) on T1. </button><button class="sentence"> As in Experiments 1 and 2, the bilingual participants were tested in the Netherlands and the monolingual participants were tested in Spain.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus and stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The experiment was controlled by a standard desktop computer. </button><button class="sentence">All stimuli were presented in a resolution of 800 × 600 pixels in 16-bit color on a 17-in.
