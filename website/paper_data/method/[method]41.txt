<h4>Study 6</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Studies 1–5 provide converging evidence that parental attachment can play an important role in terror management processes. </button><button class="sentence">However, in Studies 2 and 3, both parental primes and close friend or romantic partner primes were found to mitigate the consequences of MS. This leads to the question of how parental attachment relates to other types of attachments and what leads a person to preferentially rely on one or the other type of attachment when his or her need for security is heightened. </button><button class="sentence">Although all attachment theories posit that the initial bond with one's parents or primary caregivers forms the basis on which later relationships are founded, the present studies are the first to document the continued use of these primary attachment relationships to control existential anxiety in adult life. </button><button class="sentence">But given that young adults have now been shown to use their romantic partners, close friends, and parents as bulwarks against death-related anxiety, questions about the determinants of which others are selected for such protection must be addressed. </button><button class="sentence">As an initial step in this direction, Study 6 explored the role of attachment security in producing such preferences.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore relative preferences for different attachment figures in response to threat. </button><button class="sentence">After a copious literature search, we could find no studies that compared preferences for the solace of different relationship types as a function of an individuals' attachment style. </button><button class="sentence">Addressing this question poses a methodological challenge: How to assess participants' relationship preferences among a number of simultaneously available options. </button><button class="sentence">To this end, we created a purported marketing survey wherein participants were asked to allocate minutes on a cell phone calling plan to each of four different relationship persons (i.e., parent, sibling, romantic partner, close friend). </button><button class="sentence">Following previous TMT research (Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 2000), we hypothesized that low levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance (attachment security) would predict increased preference for close relationships with romantic partners. </button><button class="sentence">Conversely, after MS, insecurely attached individuals should report increased preference for a parent. </button><button class="sentence">However, we predicted that this effect would be specific to those with high levels of attachment anxiety and low levels of attachment avoidance, since previous research has found that such individuals have problems transferring attachment functions from parents to subsequent relationships (e.g., Allen &amp; Land, 1999; Mayseless, 2004). </button><button class="sentence">Highly avoidant individuals seem not to value attachments generally (Fraley, Davis, &amp; Shaver, 1998), so we doubted whether they would rely on parents or any other attachment figures after MS.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Participants</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants were 100 students (56 women, 44 men) recruited from introductory psychology classes at the University of Missouri—Columbia in exchange for partial course credit. </button><button class="sentence">Ages ranged from 18 to 26 years (<em>M</em> = 19.07, <em>SD</em> = 1.33).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Materials and Procedure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The study was conducted in a laboratory setting. </button><button class="sentence">All packets were identical in content except for the MS manipulation.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Attachment</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants completed Griffin and Bartholomew's (1994b) 30-item Relationship Scales Questionnaire as part of a mass screening session approximately 2 weeks prior to their participation in the study. </button><button class="sentence">Previous research attests to the scale's reliability and validity (e.g., Griffin &amp; Bartholomew, 1994a, 1994b; Kurdek, 2002). </button><button class="sentence">Given the present interest in preferences among different relationships, one advantage of this particular scale is that it measures general attachment styles as opposed to those tied to a specific type of (e.g., romantic) relationship. </button><button class="sentence">Items were presented on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>not at all like me</em>) to 5 (<em>very like me</em>). </button><button class="sentence">Since most researchers currently suggest that attachment should be measured in relation to two distinct attachment dimensions (see, e.g., Fraley &amp; Waller, 1998), we calculated separate anxiety (e.g., “I worry about being abandoned”; α = .81) and avoidant (e.g., “I find it difficult to trust others completely”; α = .72) scores following procedures recommended by Kurdek (2002;
