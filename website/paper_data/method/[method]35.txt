<h3>Study 4</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Finally, we conducted a fourth study that directly tested the validity of the selection-criteria explanation by manipulating both the salience of information direction and information quality as a selection criterion in the 2- and 10-information conditions. </button><button class="sentence">If conditions with 2 versus more than 2 (e.g., 4 or 10) pieces of information trigger different selection criteria and thus account for different information preferences in the 2- versus 10-information conditions, then the direct experimental manipulation of these two selection criteria (information direction vs. information quality) should directly affect information search, whereas the effect of information quantity on information preference should be simultaneously eliminated. </button><button class="sentence">This experimental logic is analogous to the logic of mediational analysis (Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986). </button><button class="sentence">The mediator variable (i.e., different salient selection criteria) should be connected to the dependent variable (i.e., information preference). </button><button class="sentence">That is, a direct manipulation of the mediator variable should lead to the same effect in the dependent variable as a manipulation of the independent variable (i.e., information quantity). </button><button class="sentence">In addition, if the effect of the mediator variable is statistically controlled for, the effect of the independent variable (information quantity) on the dependent variable (information preference) should be eliminated.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">In order to provide such a test, we conducted the following experiment. </button><button class="sentence">As in Study 3, participants made a personnel decision about the future career of Mr. Miller and subsequently selected 1 out of either 2 or 10 pieces of information, half supporting and half conflicting with their prior decision. </button><button class="sentence">In addition, participants were instructed to base their information selection on either information direction (direction focus) or information quality (quality focus). </button><button class="sentence">A control group received no additional instructions. </button><button class="sentence">If an increased salience of information direction is associated with an increased desire to appear unbiased and therefore causes a systematic preference for inconsistent information, then the direction focus should lead to a preference for inconsistent information in both the 2- and 10-information conditions. </button><button class="sentence">In contrast, given the quality focus, a systematic preference for consistent information was expected for the 2- as well as the 10-information condition due to the general expected quality advantage of consistent information.</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">One hundred and fifty five (112 women and 43 men, ages ranged from 19 to 49 years; <em>M</em> = 25.25, <em>SD</em> = 5.28) students from Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany, participated in this experiment. </button><button class="sentence">All participants were recruited on the university campus by asking whether they would be willing to participate in a study on decision making at the nearby Department of Psychology. </button><button class="sentence">The experiment was based on a 2 (information quantity: 2 vs. 10) × 3 (induced selection criterion: quality focus vs. direction focus vs. no focus induction) between-subjects design. </button><button class="sentence">Participants were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">As in Study 3, the Miller case was used. </button><button class="sentence">After the introduction and preliminary decision on whether the contract of the manager, Mr. Miller, should be extended or not (participants were informed that following their information search they could revise their preliminary decision), participants selected from 2 or 10 pieces of information that provided additional consistent and inconsistent information concerning their prior decision. </button><button class="sentence">However, in order to manipulate quality or direction salience, we had them read different instructions prior to information selection. </button><button class="sentence">The instruction for the quality focus was as follows: “Very important: please compare the available pieces of information with regard to their quality and select the one that is the best in your opinion, that is, the one which you consider to be most important, most credible, and most cogent. </button><button class="sentence">You can only select one of the available pieces of information.” </button><button class="sentence">Correspondingly, the instruction for the direction focus was as follows: “Very important: half of the following articles are in favor of an extension and half of them are against an extension of Mr. Miller’s contract. </button><button class="sentence">Please bear this in mind as you select a piece of information; you should just consider whether you would like to read a piece of information that supports your prior decision or one that contradicts it. You can only select one of the available pieces of information.”  Participants in the control condition received no extra focus instruction, the only instruction to them was “You can only select one of the available pieces of information.” </button><button class="sentence">Following information selection, participants made a final decision, which marked the end of the experiment. </button><button class="sentence">All participants were debriefed, informed why it was not necessary to read the selected pieces of information, and given a cup of coffee and a chocolate bar as a token of our thanks for participation.</button></p>
