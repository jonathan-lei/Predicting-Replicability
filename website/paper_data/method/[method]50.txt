<h3>Study 1</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Study 1 was designed to examine the effect of stereotype threat on the preferred social distance of White participants in an expected interracial contact. </button><button class="sentence">The principal hypothesis was that when the stereotype of racism was relevant to a potential interaction—that is, when participants expected to discuss a threatening topic—Whites would distance themselves from Black partners more than White partners. </button><button class="sentence">Under such conditions, it was further hypothesized that stereotype activation would positively correlate with the degree of avoidance.</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Eighty-two White male undergraduates at Stanford University participated in this study in exchange for either $10 or partial course credit. </button><button class="sentence">Women were not included as participants in this study. </button><button class="sentence">Previous research has shown that threat and anxiety influence mixed-gender proximity preferences differently than same-gender proximity preferences (Ugwuegbu &amp; Anusiem, 1982). </button><button class="sentence">Because “Blackness” is most commonly mentally represented by “Black males” (Goff, Thomas, &amp; Jackson, in press), it was reasoned that Black males would produce the strongest effects. </button><button class="sentence">Therefore, only men were recruited for ostensibly same-gender dyads.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">This experiment took the form of a 2 (race of partners: Black vs. White) × 2 (conversation topic: love and relationships vs. racial profiling) between-subjects design. </button><button class="sentence">The chief dependent measures were the physical distance participants put between themselves and their conversation partners and the degree to which stereotypes related to their racial identity were cognitively activated by the experimental conditions.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Word-stem completion</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">We hypothesized that participants who were talking about racial profiling would sit farther away from Black partners the more threatened they felt. </button><button class="sentence">To measure threat (and rule out the possibility that general White identity or anxiety was driving the effect), we measured the activation of three distinct concepts: White racial identity, negative stereotypes about Whites as racist, and general social anxiety. </button><button class="sentence">To measure the activation of these concepts, we used a word-stem completion task similar to that employed in previous stereotype threat research (e.g., Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995). </button><button class="sentence">Ten words were chosen for each category—White racial identity, negative stereotypes that Whites are racist, and social anxiety—from pretests involving 157 Stanford undergraduates. </button><button class="sentence">In our pretest, 127 participants simply listed words associated with one of the categories. </button><button class="sentence">The 25 most common words for each category were then selected and given to 30 participants. </button><button class="sentence">These 30 participants rated each word for how strongly related it was to its category. </button><button class="sentence">The 10 highest rated words in each category were then selected as target words. </button><button class="sentence">All words are listed in the Appendix. </button><button class="sentence">These target words were randomly intermixed with 60 filler words that could not be completed as words that would fit any of the three category concepts, creating a sheet of 90 total word stems.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">For the purpose of analysis, the number of target words a participant completed in each category was recorded. </button><button class="sentence">Of those words, the number of target words the participant filled out in a category-relevant manner (e.g., <em>RACIST</em> as opposed to <em>RACKET</em>) was counted. </button><button class="sentence">Last, the number of target words filled out in a category-relevant manner was divided by the total number of target words the participant had completed. </button><button class="sentence">This ratio, then, is the measure of concept activation.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Faces</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">To convey the race of the participants' prospective partners, we showed participants Polaroid pictures of their ostensible partners. </button><button class="sentence">Pictures of Black and White men were selected from a data set of 20 Polaroids, each of which was rated on stereotypicality and attractiveness. </button><button class="sentence">Two Black faces and two White faces were selected such that the Black faces were neither reliably more attractive (<em>M</em> = 3.50) than the White faces (<em>M</em> = 3.46) nor reliably more stereotypically Black (<em>M</em> = 4.57) than the White faces were stereotypically White (<em>M</em> = 4.50).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Distancing measurement</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The principal hypothesis was that participants would sit farther away from Black partners than White partners when participants felt under threat of confirming the negative group stereotype. </button><button class="sentence">In order to measure this, we asked participants to arrange three chairs—one for themselves and two for their two prospective partners—so that the three of them could have a “comfortable conversation.” </button><button class="sentence">Participants under the stereotype threat of possibly being seen as racist might put more distance between their own chair and the chairs of their two partners when they anticipate their partners are Black as a means of distancing themselves from the interaction. </button><button class="sentence">However, another factor could also affect the distance measure: a dispositional preference for some level of distance between all three individuals involved.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">If participants positioned themselves far away from their partners, then the configuration of chairs would look like there was an odd person out (the isosceles triangle pictured in Configuration 1.1 in Figure 1). </button><button class="sentence">However, participants who were dispositionally more comfortable with larger interpersonal distances might also create distance between themselves and their partners. </button><button class="sentence">This configuration would look quite different from one created by anxiety specific to the partners and the situation and would look more like the equilateral triangle pictured in Configuration 1.2 in Figure 1. Therefore, to capture the first of these patterns—without the second—we developed a distance index in which the average distance between the participant and his prospective conversation partners (AB distance in Figure 1) was analyzed, covarying for the total distance the participant put between all three chairs (ABC distance in Figure 1). </button><button class="sentence">This calculation allows one to capture a participant's motivation to reduce possible tension, controlling for his individual proximity preferences. </button><button class="sentence">That is, by covarying for the total distance between the three chairs, we were able to measure the relative “odd-person-out” effect. </button><button class="sentence">Individuals who sat close to one partner and far from the other would score similarly to someone who sat equidistant from both partners. </button><button class="sentence">Likewise, individuals who sat equally close to both partners but sat the partners far away from each other would score lower than individuals who sat themselves and their partners equidistant from each other. </button><button class="sentence">This odd-person-out index gives an estimate of the degree to which the participant's chair placement reflected specifically a desire to distance himself from the potential interaction partners.</button><br/><br/> <img class="rs_skip" src="/paper_data/img/psp-94-1-91-fig1a.gif" alt="psp-94-1-91-fig1a.gif"/><em>Figure 1.
