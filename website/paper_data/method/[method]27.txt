<h3>Study 7: Could a Subtle Empathy–Capability Manipulation Reduce Men's Vengefulness?</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Study 7 built on the gender interaction findings from Studies 4–6. </button><button class="sentence">The personal capability manipulations from those studies represented overt, conscious primes. </button><button class="sentence">In Study 7, we examined whether a more subtle manipulation could be effective. </button><button class="sentence">Rather than going through the conscious step of writing about one's own offense or envisioning the other person's perspective, could it be useful to simply answer questions involving personal capability and empathic understanding? </button><button class="sentence">We predicted that it would.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">We saw an opportunity to test this hypothesis in an existing data set. </button><button class="sentence">As in Study 6, this study used real-life offenses, but it also included counterbalancing of questionnaires. </button><button class="sentence">The study included questions about personal capability and empathic understanding. </button><button class="sentence">The survey was structured so that some participants answered the capability and empathy questions just before they completed the vengefulness measure, whereas others did not answer them until after the vengefulness measure. </button><button class="sentence">Our purpose in Study 7 was to see whether simply being asked to reflect on these questions would be enough to reduce vengefulness scores—at least for men.</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Participants (83 men, 72 women) were taking an introductory psychology course at a private research university in Ohio. </button><button class="sentence">They completed a survey for course credit. </button><button class="sentence">Ethnicities were primarily Caucasian (79%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (16%). </button><button class="sentence">The mean age was 18.9 (<em>SD</em> = 1.3).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">As in Studies 2 and 6, participants recalled an offense that was committed against them. </button><button class="sentence">On the basis of counterbalancing procedures,  some participants completed the capability–empathy questions before the vengefulness questions, whereas others completed them afterward.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Measures</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Unforgiveness</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">We again used the TRIM-18-R (McCullough &amp; Hoyt, 2002; whole TRIM, <em>M</em> = 2.7, <em>SD</em> = 0.9, α = .85; Vengefulness, <em>M</em> = 2.0, <em>SD</em> = 1.0, α = .90; Avoidance, <em>M</em> = 3.0, <em>SD</em> = 1.1; α = .92; Benevolence, <em>M</em> = 3.0, <em>SD</em> = 1.0, α = .91).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Personal capability and empathy</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The page assessing personal capability and empathy (which was used as the experimental manipulation here) contained three measures, the first two of which were counterbalanced. </button><button class="sentence">The four items from Study 2 assessed personal capability for committing an offense similar in severity (<em>M</em> = 4.7, <em>SD</em> = 3.1, α = .95). </button><button class="sentence">Another set of personal capability questions was modified to emphasize similarity in offense type rather than severity (e.g., “Given the right circumstances, could you be capable of doing something similar in <em>type</em> to what the other person did?”; <em>M</em> = 4.6, <em>SD</em> = 3.1, α = .94). </button><button class="sentence">The two sets of capability questions were highly correlated, <em>r</em>(155) = .66, <em>p</em> &lt; .01, and were thus combined into a single measure (<em>M</em> = 4.7, <em>SD</em> = 2.8). </button><button class="sentence">After the personal capability questions, the page included the four empathic understanding items from Study 2 (<em>M</em> = 3.8, <em>SD</em> = 2.6, α = .89).</button></p>
