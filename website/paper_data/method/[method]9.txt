To balance the critical “yes” trials, we chose 100 filler words (“no” trials) from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Wilson, 1988) based on low (less than 400, values range from 100 to 700) concreteness and imageability scores (<em>M</em>concreteness = 295; <em>M</em>imageability = 346) and matched to the critical words on length and frequency.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Twenty-two undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut completed the experiment for course credit. </button><button class="sentence">All participants were native speakers of English and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.</button></p>
