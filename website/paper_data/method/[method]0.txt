<h3>Study 2</h3><br/><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">In Study 1, effort was measured using a questionnaire. </button><button class="sentence">The correlation between participants' self-reported effort and the PSD patterns derived from their response times suggests that effort can moderate 1/<em>f</em> noise. </button><button class="sentence">Study 2 sought to bolster this claim by experimentally manipulating participants' effort on a separate computer-based measure of racial bias.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">This research essentially strives to recreate a study conducted by Payne and his colleagues (Payne et al., 2002), who asked participants to either accentuate or avoid the use of racial cues in a weapon-identification paradigm. </button><button class="sentence">Like the shoot/don't-shoot task in Study 1, this task assesses racial bias in reactions to guns and harmless objects. </button><button class="sentence">On a series of trials, participants were primed with either a Black face or a White face. </button><button class="sentence">They were then asked to identify a target image as either a gun or a tool. </button><button class="sentence">In their study, Payne and his colleagues varied the instructions they gave to participants. </button><button class="sentence">Participants in the control condition were simply asked to perform the task to the best of their ability. </button><button class="sentence">A second group was asked to perform the task but was specifically instructed to avoid the use of race. </button><button class="sentence">They were not to allow the race of the prime to influence their judgments. </button><button class="sentence">A third group was explicitly asked to make use of race during the performance of the task. </button><button class="sentence">They were asked to behave like racial profilers. </button><button class="sentence">Payne found greater bias in both experimental conditions. </button><button class="sentence">This finding makes perfect sense for the participants who were instructed to act like profilers. </button><button class="sentence">They were simply doing what they were told. </button><button class="sentence">But, ironically, the participants who were asked to avoid using the racial cues showed increases in bias. </button><button class="sentence">Relative to controls, they showed stronger associations between Blacks and guns. </button><button class="sentence">The authors suggested that because the instructions called attention to the race of the prime, participants in the experimental conditions were more susceptible to race-based associations (whether that influence was consistent or inconsistent with their instructions).</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">In addition to demonstrating an interesting and counterintuitive effect, Payne et al.'s (2002) study has clear implications for task-relevant effort. </button><button class="sentence">Participants in the control condition approached the task without any experimentally imposed demands. </button><button class="sentence">By contrast, participants in both the avoid-race and use-race conditions were asked to consciously control or modulate their performance. </button><button class="sentence">Whether or not their efforts were ultimately successful, these participants approached the task with additional experimentally imposed demands. </button><button class="sentence">If 1/<em>f</em> noise is sensitive to increased effort, spectral analysis should reveal differences between the relatively minimal effort required of the control condition and the greater effort required of the experimental conditions.</button></p> <h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">Seventy-one undergraduates participated in return for course credit. </button><button class="sentence">All participants performed a simple task in which they were asked to classify objects that appeared on a computer screen as either guns or tools. </button><button class="sentence">Prior to the presentation of the target object, however, participants were primed with either a Black or a White face (Payne, 2001). </button><button class="sentence">Although all participants performed the same task, individuals were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, each imposing a different task-relevant goal. </button><button class="sentence">Participants in the control condition were given no specific instructions; participants in the avoid-race condition were instructed not to use racial information when making their decisions; participants in the use-race condition were instructed to let racial cues guide their behavior during the task. </button><button class="sentence">This study followed a 3 (instructions: control vs. avoid race vs. use race) × 2 (prime race: Black vs. White) × 2 (object type: gun vs. tool) mixed-model design, with repeated measures on the last two factors.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">The weapon-identification task was based on the paradigm developed by Payne (2001, Study 1). </button><button class="sentence">The task consisted of a 25-trial practice phase followed by a test phase of 200 trials. </button><button class="sentence">Each trial began with the presentation of a prime face (200 ms). </button><button class="sentence">Primes consisted of black-and-white photographs (faces only) of five Black men and five White men. </button><button class="sentence">Immediately after the prime, a target object appeared (200 ms). </button><button class="sentence">Target stimuli consisted of black-and-white photographs of 5 guns and 5 power tools (drills, screwdrivers, etc). </button><button class="sentence">After 200 ms, the target image was replaced with a mask (a random pattern of black and white rectangles), which remained on screen until the participant responded. </button><button class="sentence">A 1,000-ms intertrial interval preceded the onset of the next prime.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">In the original study, Payne and his colleagues (2002) forced participants to respond within 700–1,200 ms after the onset of the object image. </button><button class="sentence">They also presented the target object for only 100 ms (rather than 200 ms, as in the present research). </button><button class="sentence">Payne et al.'s parameters were presumably motivated by their interest in process dissociation procedure estimates of control and automatic bias, which are derived from patterns of errors (see also Payne, 2001, Study 2). </button><button class="sentence">More restrictive time limits tend to increase the likelihood of errors in these tasks. </button><button class="sentence">By contrast, the current research focuses on variance in reaction times, and forcing participants to respond within a given time window carries with it the possibility that participants will respond too slowly on some trials, resulting in missing data, which (as noted above) are problematic for the analysis. </button><button class="sentence">The test phase of Study 2 therefore imposed no response deadline. </button><button class="sentence">To encourage participants to respond quickly, the practice phase imposed a deadline of 1,000 ms. Participants who responded too slowly during the initial 25 trials received a message to that effect. </button><button class="sentence">Fewer than 1% of responses exceeded 1,000 ms during the test phase.</button></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><button class="sentence">A White male experimenter introduced the study as an investigation of vigilance. </button><button class="sentence">He seated participants in individual rooms, each equipped with a computer. </button><button class="sentence">A randomly selected computer program delivered the instructions, which constituted the experimental manipulation. </button><button class="sentence">These instructions were taken directly from Payne et al.
