The number of occurrences and opportunities of a response are calculated for Repetitions 1 to 4. There is 1 occurrence of Response Q among the two cells that have 1 prior occurrence of that response (those at the second and third presentations of the repeated sequence; see Column Q in Table 1). </button><button class="sentence">For that participant, we count 1 occurrence and 2 opportunities for producing that response at Repetition 1.
