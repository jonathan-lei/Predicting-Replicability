According to <a href="#c5">Bassok et al. (1998)</a>, unlike categorically related sets that preserve a one-to-one mapping with the structure of <strong data-auto="strong_text">addition</strong> (e.g., 4 ants + 3 beetles = 7 insects), semantically unrelated sets are misaligned with <strong data-auto="strong_text">addition</strong>. This misalignment arises because one would need to traverse many links in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> network to find the superset that corresponds to their sum (e.g., 4 hens + 3 radios = 7 things). Such intermediate links (e.g., hens are farm birds, which are animate creatures, which are things) introduce relational mismatches with the operation of <strong data-auto="strong_text">addition</strong>, in which the addends are directly related to their sum.</p><a id="xlm-34-2-343-ID0ECCCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One hundred fifty-four University of Washington introductory <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> students, 91 women and 63 men, participated for course extra credit.

Each trial consisted of a <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> word pair (e.g., <em>tulips–daisies</em>) with its word target (e.g., <em>tulips</em>) and a pair of cue digits (e.g., <em>2 + 3</em>) with its digit target (e.g., <em>5</em>). Below, we first describe the word and the digit triplets and then explain how the word and the digit triplets were combined.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Word triplets</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All word stimuli were plural nouns that could serve as referents of object sets (e.g., <em>birds</em>, <em>coats</em>, <em>thieves</em>, <em>stories</em>). We first selected a set of candidate singular nouns from word-norms databases (<a href="#c7">Battig &amp; Montague, 1969</a>; <a href="#c15">Coltheart, 1981</a>). The candidate words were in the upper 10% of word frequency, familiarity, and concreteness. Their syllable count was restricted to be between one and five. From this candidate word set, we constructed 80 word triplets in which the nouns were transformed from singulars to plurals (e.g., from <em>stain</em> to <em>stains</em> ). Half of the triplets consisted of categorically related nouns, which we refer to as <em>aligned-categorical</em>, or AC, <em>triplets</em> (e.g., <em>oaks</em>, <em>elms</em>, and <em>maples</em>).<a id="b-fn3"> </a><sup><a href="#fn3" /></sup> The other half consisted of unrelated nouns, which we refer to as <em>misaligned-unrelated</em>, or MU, <em>triplets</em> (e.g., <em>marbles</em>, <em>guards</em>, and <em>ponds</em>). The two sets of AC and MU triplets were matched for word frequency, familiarity, concreteness, and syllable count. The AC and MU word triplets appear, respectively, in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> and <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>.<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/0ce1de182c6a5b3e28e5c3723b4ab06c/5ebcb188/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-2-343-tbl1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-343-tbl1a.gif" title="Aligned Categorically Related Word Triplets" /><em>Aligned Categorically Related Word Triplets</em></span><br /><br /><a id="tbl2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/55ab4dc2473cf6760f6353431f67c32b/5ebcb188/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-2-343-tbl2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-343-tbl2a.gif" title="Misaligned Unrelated Word Triplets" /><em>Misaligned Unrelated Word Triplets</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In each word triplet, two words were designated to serve as the <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> word pair and the third as the target. In order to balance the number of “yes” and “no” responses, half of the target words matched one of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> words (correct response is “yes”) and the other half did not (correct response is “no”). Specifically, of the 40 AC triplets, 20 had a matching target (e.g., <em>horses</em>, <em>donkeys</em>, and <em>horses</em>) and 20 a nonmatching AC target (e.g., <em>ants</em>, <em>beetles</em>, and <em>spiders</em>). Similarly, of the 40 MU triplets, 20 had a matching target (e.g., <em>gowns</em>, <em>bridges</em>, and <em>bridges</em>) and 20 a nonmatching MU target (e.g., <em>napkins</em>, <em>cats</em>, and <em>authors</em>). Half of the matching targets matched the left, and the other half matched the right words of the <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> pairs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Relatedness ratings for all the <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> word pairs used in Experiment 1 were obtained from a subset of participants (<em>n</em> = 33) after they had completed all the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trials of the word-digit matching task. These participants rated the extent to which the <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> word pairs were related to each other on a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating that the words were completely unrelated and 7 indicating that the words were highly related. Each participant provided ratings to 60 word pairs that were selected at random from the 80 <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> pairs used in the experiment. AC pairs (<em>M</em> = 5.97, <em>SD</em> = 0.73) received significantly higher relatedness ratings than the MU pairs (<em>M</em> =1.42, <em>SD</em> = 0.42), <em>t</em>(32) = 37.60, <em>p</em> &lt; .001.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Digit triplets</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Forty-eight digit triplets were adapted from the “standard” stimuli cues used by <a href="#c36">Lefevre and Kulak (1994)</a>. Each digit triplet consisted of a pair of cue digits and a digit target. The cue digits (<em>m</em> + <em>n</em>) were of the form <em>m</em> &gt; 1, <em>n</em> &gt; 1, and <em>m</em> ≠ <em>n</em> (e.g., 3 + 2). Half of the digit targets matched one of the cue digits and half did not. Half of the matching targets matched the left and half matched the right cue digit.

Only triplets with nonmatching digit targets are relevant for assessing the sum effect (24 triplets total). The cue digits of these triplets appear in the leftmost column of <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>. The target digits ranged from 5 to 9 and, depending on the cue digits, served as either sum or neutral targets. Twelve triplets consisted of the cue digits and their sum target (e.g., 5, for the cue digits 3 + 2), and 12 consisted of the cue digits and a neutral target (e.g., 7).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the other 24 triplets, the targets matched one of the cue digits (correct answer is “yes”). Half of the matching target triplets served as <em>cue</em> controls. In these 12 triplets, the cue digits were the same as those used in the nonmatching sum and neutral triplets (e.g., 3 + 2; see the leftmost column of <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>) and were in the 2–6 digit range. The other half of the matching target triplets served as <em>target</em> controls. These 12 triplets were constructed to ensure that the matching targets (“yes” response) covered the same digit range (5–9) as the nonmatching targets (“no” response). Accordingly, the cue digits in the target control triplets (e.g., 8 + 4; see the rightmost column of <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>) had sums larger than 10.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Apparatus</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Written instructions and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trials were presented on 17-in. (43-cm) monitors controlled by PC computers. Responses to digit and word targets (yes and no) and response latencies were recorded with the use of Inquisit software Version 1.31 software (<a href="#c30">Inquisit, 2000</a>), which is accurate to 0.08 ms. All stimuli presentation times were multiples of the screen refresh rate of 16.7 ms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In order to ensure that people attend to both the <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> words and the cue digits, on each <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trial, participants had to make two matching decisions (“Did you see X? yes/no”): one to a word target (e.g., X = <em>ants</em>; X = <em>spiders</em>) and one to a digit target (e.g., X = <em>3</em>; X = <em>9</em>). To discourage dual-tasking strategies, on half of the trials, the digit target appeared first and was followed by the word target, and on the other half, the word target appeared first. Although participants responded to both word and digit targets, only trials in which the digit targets appeared first (i.e., immediately after the cue digits) preserved the structure of the original number-matching task (<a href="#c35">LeFevre et al., 1988</a>). These trials provide the cleanest test of whether semantically aligned or misaligned word pairs would prime the sum effect. Hence, we only report the results pertaining to the latencies and error rates of the relevant digit targets in the digit-first condition, comparing the trials in which these digits were primed by the semantically aligned and the semantically misaligned word pairs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were tested in small groups of 4–13. They received verbal and written instructions explaining that they would see pairs of words and digits and, subsequently, see word and digit probes. Their task was to respond “yes” if the probe was one of the items that were just presented and “no” if it was not. Participants were instructed to place the index finger of their preferred hand on the <em>2</em> key on the numerical keypad of the keyboard. They had to indicate their “yes” and “no” responses by pressing the <em>1</em> and <em>3</em> (or <em>3</em> and <em>1</em>) keys, respectively, and then return their index finger to the centered <em>2</em> key. They were instructed to respond as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Participants were also told that they would be taking a <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> recognition test at the end of the word-digit matching task to test their <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> for the words seen during the experiment. This instruction was intended to encourage <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> processing of the words (<a href="#c45">Schreuder, Giovanni, &amp; Glazenborg, 1984</a>), but we did not administer the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> test.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> depicts the sequence of events on each <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trial. Each trial began with an asterisk prompt in the middle of the screen. The prompt remained on the screen until the participant pressed the <em>2</em> key on the numeric keypad of the keyboard. At this keypress, a randomly selected pair of <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> words appeared on the screen. The words were presented in line-drawn boxes, one box on the left and the other on the right side of the screen's center. After 480 ms of this words display, a pair of randomly selected cue digits appeared in the boxes above the words, and a <em>plus</em> sign appeared between the two boxes. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">priming</strong> words and the cue digits remained on the screen for an additional 135 ms, at which point the stimuli were erased and masked for 16.7 ms. The computer then randomly selected either a digit or a word target and displayed it at the center of the screen. This target remained on the screen until the participant responded, or for a maximum of 2 s.<br /><br /><a id="fig1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/576b65fb27d3e2db45b7cc10995b309d/5ebcb188/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-2-343-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-343-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

They received written feedback, either “RIGHT” in green letters or “WRONG” in red letters, which remained on the screen for 500 ms. Lack of response within 2 s also received the feedback “WRONG.” After the feedback to the first target disappeared, the second target was presented at the center of the screen. In the digit-first condition, the second target was a word; in the word-first condition, the second target was a digit. Participants responded to the second target in the same manner they responded to the first. Consecutive trials were separated by a forced 2-s delay.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Each participant received a unique randomized sequence of 160 trials that had a balanced 4 (word triplet) × 4 (digit triplet) ×2 (target order) factorial design, with five trials in each <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> cell. The four word-triplet conditions were AC prime/matching target, AC prime/nonmatching target, MU prime/matching target, and MU prime/nonmatching target. The four digit-triplet conditions were sum, neutral, cue control, and target control. The two target-order conditions were digit first and word first. The word triplets were selected at random without replacement until all 80 triplets were exhausted and then sampled again for a total of 160 trials. The digit triplets were selected at random without replacement until all 48 triplets were exhausted, and this sampling was repeated for a total of 160 trials. The constraints on the random draw of the word and digit combinations were such that there were no more than two consecutive identical trial types and no more than four identical consecutive correct responses (e.g., “no”).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants received 20 practice trials that were similar to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trials. Although we wanted participants to get familiar with the matching task, we did not want them to think about the <strong data-auto="strong_text">relation</strong> between the words and the digits. Accordingly, all the word triplets in the practice trials were unrelated (e.g., <em>notes</em>, <em>cords</em>, and <em>tubes</em>). These word triplets were not used in the subsequent <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trials. The practice trials were followed by a brief clarification break during which the experimenter verified that the participants understood the task. The participants then proceeded to perform the 160 <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> trials. They took approximately 12 min to complete this task.</p><a id="xlm-34-2-343-ID0EBCCAA"> </a>
