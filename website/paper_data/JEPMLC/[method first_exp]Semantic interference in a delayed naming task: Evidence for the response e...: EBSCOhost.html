Half participated in the immediate <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> condition, half in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">delayed</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> condition. All were paid for their participation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Forty pictures of common objects were selected from <a href="#c23">Snodgrass and Vanderwart's (1980)</a> picture database and were scaled to fit within a 245-pixels wide × 240-pixels high rectangle. Half the pictures had low frequency names (range = 1–9 per million), and half had high frequency names (range = 72–724 per million). Properties of the pictures and their names in the low and high frequency conditions are presented in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. A related word was selected for each picture, and the unrelated items were created by re-pairing each word with an unrelated picture from the other frequency category. Thus, the same words appeared in the semantically related and unrelated conditions (see <a href="#A">Appendix A</a>). In the design there were two crossed <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> variables (i.e., frequency and <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> relatedness) with two levels of each variable. Each cell in the design had 20 items, leading to a total of 80 <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> items. For each <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> item the distractor word was colored blue. For the filler items the color of the distractor words was red. Participants' <strong data-auto="strong_text">task</strong> in both immediate and <strong data-auto="strong_text">delayed</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> conditions alternated unpredictably between picture <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> and distractor word reading on the basis of the color of the distractor word, with blue distractors designating picture <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> and red distractors designating word reading.<br /><br /><a id="tbl1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/9e4b13e31c94ddf44f1d33d938a24745/5ebcb198/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-1-249-tbl1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-249-tbl1a.gif" title="Properties of Low Frequency and High Frequency Items in Experiment 1" /><em>Properties of Low Frequency and High Frequency Items in Experiment 1</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A total of 160 items were included in each <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> condition (immediate and <strong data-auto="strong_text">delayed</strong>). Twelve additional pictures and words were selected to form 36 practice items. Distractor words were assigned to pictures and were colored appropriately such that 18 picture <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> and 18 word reading items were created.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> and filler items were pseudorandomized into four blocks of trials. Within a given block there were an equal number of each condition, and each picture appeared once per block, either in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> or in the filler condition. Care was taken that (a) on consecutive trials there was no <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> or phonological relationship between pictures' names or distractor words, and (b) no more than three consecutive trials were from the same condition. The order of the blocks was counterbalanced according to an orthogonal Latin-square design into four lists.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment was controlled by DMDX software (<a href="#c7">Forster &amp; Forster, 2003</a>). There were three phases in the experiment. In the first phase, participants were familiarized with all of the pictures and their names. In this phase, on each trial, a fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced with the picture for 2,000 ms. After 1,000 ms, the picture name appeared beneath the picture and cued the participant to pronounce the picture name aloud. The second phase consisted of 36 trials in which the <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">task</strong> was practiced. Participants were instructed to name pictures or words depending on the color of the word. If the word was colored blue they were instructed to name the picture; whereas if the word was colored red they were to read the word. The third phase was the experiment proper. The trial structure of the second and third phases was identical.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants either took part in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">delayed</strong> or in the immediate <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> condition. Participants in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">delayed</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> condition were instructed to postpone their <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> response until the distractor word was presented. On each trial in the <strong data-auto="strong_text">delayed</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> condition, a fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced by a picture. After the picture was presented for 1,000 ms, the distractor word appeared. The pictures and distractor words remained on the screen for 500 ms. An empty screen was then displayed for 1,000 ms. Participants in the immediate <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> condition were instructed to name the picture or word upon presentation (depending on the color of the word). The trial structure for the immediate <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> condition was identical except for the fact that the distractor appeared simultaneously with the presentation of the picture. The picture and distractor remained on the screen for 500 ms. The participant initiated the next trial by pressing the space bar. The duration of the experiment was about 25 min.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Only the picture <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> trials were analyzed. Three types of responses were excluded from the analysis of response times (RTs): (a) <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> errors, (b) verbal disfluencies (stuttering, utterance repairs, production of nonverbal sounds), (c) recording failures, and (d) RTs below 300 or above 3,000 ms (immediate <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong>, 4.7%; <strong data-auto="strong_text">delayed</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong>, 5.3%). RTs exceeding a cutoff value (defined as a participant's and an item's mean plus three standard deviations) were replaced by the cutoff value (immediate <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong>, 2.0%; <strong data-auto="strong_text">delayed</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong>, 4.4%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the analyses reported here we distinguish between by-subjects (<em>F</em><em>1</em>) and by-items (<em>F</em>2) analyses. For the <em>F</em>1 analyses we treat frequency and <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> relatedness as within-subjects variables. For the <em>F</em>2 analyses we treat frequency as a between-subjects variable and <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> relatedness as a within-subjects variable. We report separate analyses for the immediate and <strong data-auto="strong_text">delayed</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">naming</strong> conditions.
