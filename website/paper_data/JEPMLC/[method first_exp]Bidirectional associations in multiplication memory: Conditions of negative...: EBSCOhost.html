In the present study, we sought converging evidence for the reverse association using a different transfer paradigm from that employed by <a href="#c20">Rickard (2005)</a>. In Rickard's transfer study (Experiment 1), participants received 40 practice blocks of alternating factoring problems (8 = ? × ?) and <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> problems (3 × 4 = ?). During the subsequent <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> test phase, participants received the items practiced by factoring (i.e., practiced 8 = ? × ? then tested on 2 × 4); the practiced <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> problems; and new, unpracticed <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> problems. Relative to new problems, factoring facilitated corresponding <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> problems substantially; improvement was 59% of that observed from practicing <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong>. Thus, factoring appeared to strengthen the corresponding <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> fact, although not as much as practicing <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong>. Rickard argued that the same <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> structure is strengthened by factoring or multiplying but that there are also operation-specific processes that are strengthened, which results in larger savings for the same operation than if there were an operation change at test.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In Experiment 1, we attempted to extend the <a href="#c20">Rickard (2005)</a> transfer results using a pretest–practice–posttest design. Rickard examined inter-operation transfer from factoring to <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> only, but the IE-r model predicts that there also should be transfer from practicing <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> to factoring. Therefore, in Experiment 1, we examined effects of practicing <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> (2 × 7 = ?) on performance of the same problem (2 × 7 = ?) and performance on the corresponding factoring problem (14 = _ × _ ?). One group of participants performed <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> during the pretest and posttest, and the other group performed factoring. Both groups practiced only <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> during the practice phase. During the pretest and posttest, three experimentally defined problem sets were tested: practiced problems (composed from a subset of four factors, either 2, 4, 7, 8 or 3, 5, 6, 9), unrelated problems (composed from the factor set not used for the practiced problems), and related problems (composed of one factor from the practice set and one not used for the practice set). During the practice phase, participants received 15 continuous blocks of the practice set presented as <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> problems. This pretest–practice–posttest design allowed us to measure transfer from <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> practice to the same <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> problem and to the corresponding factoring problem, with the unrelated problems providing a control baseline. The related problems could be informative as well. <a href="#c18">Phenix and Campbell (2004)</a> demonstrated that <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> fact retrieval is subject to retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). RIF is the phenomenon whereby repeated retrieval of a subset of items results in increased retrieval difficulty for related items that were not practiced (<a href="#c2">Anderson, Bjork, &amp; Bjork, 2000</a>; <a href="#c3">Anderson &amp; Green, 2001</a>; <a href="#c4">Anderson, Green, &amp; McCulloch, 2000</a>). Similarly, Phenix and Campbell found that repeatedly practicing some members of a times-table family (e.g., 7 × 2, 7 × 3, 7 × 4,…7 × 9) resulted in slower response times for other members of the family. Thus, comparing related and unrelated problems at posttest was expected to provide a measure of RIF in this experiment.</p><a id="xlm-34-3-546-ID0ECECAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Twenty-eight volunteers (23 women, 5 men) were recruited from the participant pool organized by the Department of <strong data-auto="strong_text">Psychology</strong> at the University of Saskatchewan. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 21 years (<em>M</em> = 18.8), reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision and, received bonus credit in their introductory <strong data-auto="strong_text">psychology</strong> course for participation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli and Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment consisted of three phases, including a pretest, practice, and posttest. There were two pretest and three posttest blocks in which all 21 <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> problems were presented in a random order. During the pretest and posttest, participants in the factoring group received the product (e.g., 56) and typed in the corresponding factors (7 8) in either order. <strong data-auto="strong_text">Multiplication</strong> participants received the factors (7 × 8) and typed the correct product (56). Odd or even participant number determined assignment to the factoring or <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> group. During the practice phase, participants received 15 continuous blocks of seven practice-set problems, in random order, presented as <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> problems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Among the 21 problems tested in the pretest and posttest phases, there were the seven practice-set problems, seven unrelated problems composed from operands not used for the practice set, and seven related problems that included one operand used for the practice set. To create these sets, seven problems were composed from the factors 2, 4, 7, and 8 (8 = 4 × 2, 14 = 7 × 2, 28 = 7 × 4, 32 = 8 × 4, 49 = 7 × 7, 56 = 7 × 8, 64 = 8 × 8) and seven others from the factors 3, 5, 6, and 9 (15 = 5 × 3, 25 = 5 × 5, 27 = 9 × 3, 30 = 6 × 5, 45 = 9 × 5, 54 = 9 × 6, 81 = 9 × 9). Assignment of these two sets to the practice and unrelated conditions was counterbalanced across participants. Practice and unrelated problems were unrelated in virtue of sharing no common factor. Seven related problems were composed that contained one factor that appeared in the practice set and one that did not appear in the practice set. All participants received the same related problem set, which included 6 = 3 × 2, 10 = 5 × 2, 20 = 5 × 4, 21 = 7 × 3, 42 = 7 × 6, 48 = 8 × 6, 72 = 9 × 8. Although absolute performance on the related set cannot be compared with the practice and unrelated sets because of the possibility that the related set differs in difficulty from the other two, changes in performance for the related set between pretest and posttest can be meaningfully interpreted (cf. <a href="#c18">Phenix &amp; Campbell, 2004</a>). <strong data-auto="strong_text">Multiplication</strong> problems always appeared with the larger factor on the left. All problems were presented horizontally in white characters against a dark background. Characters were approximately 3 mm wide by 5 mm high.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment required approximately 30 min and took place in a quiet room with a researcher present. An IBM-type computer was used, with two high-resolution monitors to display stimuli. The researcher sat behind the participant, and each viewed a separate monitor. The instructions for the task emphasized both speed and accuracy. Factoring participants were instructed to use the numbers 2 through 9 as factors and were informed that factor order did not matter. Participants entered their responses using the number pad on the computer keyboard. RT was measured from stimulus onset to the final keystroke.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To begin each trial, a fixation dot appeared in the center of the screen for 1 s, then flashed twice. The problem appeared on what would have been the third flash. <strong data-auto="strong_text">Multiplication</strong> problems occupied a seven-character field (e.g., 7 × 2), with the <strong data-auto="strong_text">multiplication</strong> sign at fixation. For factoring problems, the stimulus (e.g., 14) appeared with the leftmost character at fixation. The problem remained on the screen until the participant had completed their response. Presentation of problems within each block was continuous, but participants received a short break after the pretest–posttest and practice phases. Participants did not receive feedback about speed or accuracy.</p><a id="xlm-34-3-546-ID0EBECAA"> </a>
