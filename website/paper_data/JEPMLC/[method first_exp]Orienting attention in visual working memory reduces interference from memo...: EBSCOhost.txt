If the retro-cue benefit remains, then the decay hypothesis can be largely ruled out. Our experiment is unique in several respects. First, participants completed the task under articulatory suppression. On each trial they quickly rehearsed a prespecified word out loud to reduce verbal recoding (<a href="#c3">Baddeley, 1986</a>). Second, we tried to equate the duration of <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> retention by keeping constant the interval between the initial encoding and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> refreshing. In the retro-cue condition, after an initial <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> array and a blank retention interval of 1 s, a central arrow cue was presented for 100 ms, pointing to the location of a <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> item that might later change. Assuming that participants started to refresh their VWM of the target item upon the onset of the cue, the effective <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> retention interval would be 1,000 ms. The probe array was further delayed by 400 ms, such that the interstimulus interval (ISI) between <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> and probe arrays was 1,500 ms. In the simultaneous-cue condition, after the initial <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> array and a blank retention interval of 1 s, the probe array along with a central arrow cue was presented, pointing to the critical item that might change. The effective retention interval was also 1,000 ms, but the ISI between <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> and probe arrays was 500 ms shorter than in the retro-cue condition, so any advantage in the retro-cue condition cannot be accounted for by differences in retention interval. Finally, in the no-cue condition, the trial sequence was the same as in the simultaneous-cue condition except that the central arrow was absent. <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> illustrates a schematic trial sequence used in the three different conditions. Note that the no-cue condition was essentially a whole-report procedure, whereas the other two conditions were both partial-report procedures, with the retro-cue condition being similar to <a href="#c24">Landman et al.'s (2003)</a> method.<br /><br /><a id="fig2"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/ab8daebee2f53226993499a9c02d0103/5ebcb1ae/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-2-369-fig2a.gif" alt="xlm-34-2-369-fig2a.gif" title="Figure 2.

We also tested whether the effect was seen when the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> and probe arrays did not overlap in screen locations (<a href="#c18">Griffin &amp; Nobre 2003</a>; <a href="#c25">Lepsien et al., 2005</a>). Specifically, items on the probe array might occupy the same screen locations as items on the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> display, or they might occupy locations that were 1.5 times expanded toward the periphery. As noted in the introduction, one explanation of the retro-cue benefit can be found in the probe <strong data-auto="strong_text">interference</strong> account, which states that VWM is vulnerable to <strong data-auto="strong_text">interference</strong> from subsequent <strong data-auto="strong_text">visual</strong> input unless <strong data-auto="strong_text">attention</strong> has already focused on the critical <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong>. This account does not specify whether or not <strong data-auto="strong_text">interference</strong> from the probe array is screen based. If it is, expanding the probe array should reduce <strong data-auto="strong_text">interference</strong> on VWM, and consequently the no-cue and simultaneous-cue performance should improve to match that of the retro-cue.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, Experiment 1 tested both color VWM and shape VWM to ensure that the same pattern of results holds for different <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> tasks. Because VWM for color is typically better than VWM for shape (<a href="#c1">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh, 2004</a>; <a href="#c15">Eng, Chen, &amp; Jiang, 2005</a>), we used different <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> loads for the two tasks (six colors and four shapes).</p><a id="xlm-34-2-369-ID0ECDCAA"> </a><h4>Method</h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants tested in this study were volunteers from Harvard University and its community. They provided informed consent and received one course credit or $10/hr. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal <strong data-auto="strong_text">visual</strong> acuity and normal color vision. They ranged from 18 to 31 years old. There were 18 participants in Experiment 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Equipment</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were tested individually in a room with normal interior lighting. They sat approximately 57 cm away from a 19″ computer monitor. The experiment was programmed with psychophysical toolbox software (<a href="#c7">Brainard, 1997</a>; <a href="#c37">Pelli, 1997</a>) implemented in MATLAB, which can be accessed at the following website: <a href="http://www.mathworks.com" target="_blank">http://www.mathworks.com</a>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Materials and trial sequence</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">On each trial, six unique color disks (diameter = 1.31°) and four unique novel shapes (1.31°) were placed equidistantly on an imaginary circle (radius = 4.92°) centered at fixation. The background of the display was black. The number of items was selected to exceed the conventional VWM capacity (<a href="#c1">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh, 2004</a>; <a href="#c28">Luck &amp; Vogel, 1997</a>). Colors were selected randomly from nine different colors, and shapes were selected from 10 novel shapes (<a href="#c45">Shuman &amp; Kanwisher, 2004</a>). The <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> display was presented for 300 ms and followed by a blank retention interval of 1,000 ms. In the retro-cue condition, a central white arrow (1.44° in length) was presented for 100 ms, followed by a blank interval of 400 ms, before the presentation of the probe array. In the simultaneous-cue condition, after the 1,000-ms blank interval, the central arrow was presented simultaneously with the probe array for 100 ms, after which only the probe array remained. The probe array contained six colors or four shapes placed equidistantly on an imaginary circle whose radius was either the same as the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> array or 1.5 times greater, creating an overlapped condition and an expanded condition, respectively. Finally, in the no-cue condition, the presentation sequence was the same as that of the simultaneous-cue condition, except that the central arrow was absent.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In all conditions, participants were told to determine whether the probe array was identical to the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> array or whether one of the items had changed color (in the color blocks) or shape (in the shape blocks) by pressing the <em>S</em> key for “same” and the <em>D</em> key for “different.” They were told that when the central arrow cue was presented, it was always 100% valid, in that items not cued would never change. Participants were also informed that if a change occurred to the cued item, which happened 50% of time, it would be a new color (or shape) not presented on the <strong data-auto="strong_text">memory</strong> array. Participants were free to move their eyes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In both the color and shape tasks, we used a 3 × 2 × 2 design with cue condition (retro-cue, simultaneous cue, or no cue), spatial relation (overlapped or expanded), and item change (present or absent) manipulated orthogonally. There were 240 trials in color VWM and 240 trials in shape VWM. Half of the participants completed the color task first, while the other half completed the shape task first. Trials within the color (or shape) task were randomly intermixed in presentation order. Unlike accuracy, speed of response was not emphasized.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Articulatory suppression</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To minimize verbal recoding, participants were required to rehearse out loud a three-letter word as quickly as they could throughout a block of trials.
