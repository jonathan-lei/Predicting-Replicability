      We hope to improve the ability to forecast replications and identify
      effective tools toobtain confidence on social science claims, with
      economical and scalable approach. The term “replication” refers to whether
      repetition of a research study by some independent research group will
      lead to the same result as the original study. We hope that we can
      crowdsourcing the assessment of social science studies to people on online
      platforms and can use machine learning techniques to generate accurate
      predictions about the replicability of the studies using the inputs
      obtained from these people. Ultimately, we hope to help improve the
      quality of social science research.

      You will take part in this research online. You will enter an online
      survey webpage wedesigned and complete a survey process. The whole process
      takes about 1 hour andthe exact time depends on how fast you read
      materials and answer questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our website, you will be asked to read the summaries and some sections
      of a few scientific papers. After reading the materials for each paper,
      you will be asked somequestions about the accessibility of the writing and
      the plausibility of the findings in the paper. You will be asked to do
      some simple summarizing tasks, and to make predictions about the
      replicability of the main findings of the paper. At the end, you will be
      asked to complete a brief exit survey about your age, gender, highest
      degree, possible feedback for our study and our online survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not be asked to interact with any real person. We will present
      the instructions of how to finish the survey in the entering page of our
      website.
