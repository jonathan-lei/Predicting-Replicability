Each problem consisted of a digit on the left, which indicated the target for this problem, followed by a sequence of 20 digits. Each sequence consisted of two occurrences of an <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> (e.g., the digit 4 systematically followed the digit 6) and two occurrences of a <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> (e.g., the digit 7 systematically followed the digit 3, with a variable digit intervening between the digits 3 and 7). An example of a sequence is: 5 8 5 6 4 3 9 7 1 0 8 6 4 9 3 0 7 2 2 1 (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Participants had to browse the 20-digit sequences, from left to right, in order to detect the targets. When participants detected a target, they had to calculate the difference between two digits, either the two digits that immediately followed the target or the two digits that immediately surrounded the target. All of the participants had to circle the target and the two digits they had to subtract from each other when the absolute value of their difference equaled three. It is worth noting that participants never had to circle the elements forming the <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong>, as neither the difference between 6 and 4 nor the difference between 3 and 7 equals 3 (or −3). After this study phase, the same recognition test was used in the two groups to assess the <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> of both <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong>.<br /><br /><a id="fig1"> </a><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="http://largecontent.ebsco-content.com/embimages/9014c5ffc4ca9433278e80988daba98d/5ebcb1ab/pdh/xlm/xlm-34-1-80-fig1a.gif" alt="xlm-34-1-80-fig1a.gif" title="Figure 1.

Note that this pattern of results cannot be attributed to intrinsic properties of the material, as the material included the very same <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong> for all of the participants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Method</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Participants</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A total of 192 undergraduate students from the Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France, participated in the experiment in partial fulfillment of a course requirement. All participants were native French speakers. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four <strong data-auto="strong_text">Dependency</strong> Type × Digit Combination <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> groups (<em>n</em> = 48 for each group).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Materials</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stimuli used in the study phase consisted of 20 problems composed of a target digit inside a rectangle on the left (which indicated the value of the target for this problem) and a sequence of 20 digits on the right (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). In every sequence, (a) each of the 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) occurred twice, (b) a pair of digits forming an <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> (e.g., <em>64</em>) occurred twice, and (c) a pair of digits forming a <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> (e.g., <em>3X7</em>) occurred twice. The <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> pairs were identical for all of the problems presented to a given participant. For each problem, the target digit was selected randomly among the digits 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9, that is, those digits that were not elements of the pairs forming the <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong>. When the task involved a subtraction between <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> digits, the target digit occurred once just before one of the two pairs of digits forming an <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> and once in another position. When the task involved a subtraction between <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> digits, the target digit occurred once between the two pairs of digits forming a <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> and once in another position. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1a</a> shows three problems with the <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> pair <em>64</em>, and with the <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> pair <em>3X7</em>, when the task consisted in deciding whether the difference between the two digits following the target digit equals three (this is the case for the second problem in which the digits 8 and 5 follow the target 1). <a href="#fig1">Figure 1b</a> shows three problems with the <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> pair <em>64</em>, and with the <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> pair <em>3X7</em>, when the task consists in deciding whether the difference between the two digits surrounding the target digit equals three (this is the case for the second problem in which the digits 4 and 1 surround the target 2).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For each participant, a set of 20 problems was generated. For each problem, the value of the target digit, the position of the two pairs forming the <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong>, the position of the two pairs forming the <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong>, and the position of the residual digits were determined randomly. Different randomizations were used for each participant. This led to the construction of 192 different sets of 20 problems. For half of the problems, the <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong> were <em>64</em> and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong> were <em>3X7</em>, and for the other half, the <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong> were <em>37</em> and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong> were <em>6X4</em>. Each of the 192 sets of 20 problems was printed in Verdana font, size 12, on a single A4 sheet of paper (21.0 × 29.7 cm). The distances were 1.5 cm between the target digit inside the rectangle and the first digit of the sequence and 0.7 cm between two successive digits of the sequence. There was a distance of 1.0 cm between two successive problems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A two-choice recognition test was used to assess participants' <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> and <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong>. The stimuli used in this test consisted of 16 pairs of three-digit strings. Each pair contained a legal string and an illegal string. Eight pairs were used to assess the <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong>. For the participants who were exposed to <em>64</em> as the <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> and <em>3X7</em> as the <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> during the study phase, the legal string was <em>64X</em> for four pairs and <em>X64</em> for four other pairs. The illegal string resulted from a spacing violation in four pairs <em>6X4</em> and from an order violation in four other pairs <em>46X</em> or <em>X46</em>. Eight other pairs were used to assess the <strong data-auto="strong_text">learning</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependencies</strong>. The legal string was <em>3X7</em> for the eight pairs. The illegal string resulted from a spacing violation in four pairs <em>37X</em> or <em>X37</em> and from an order violation in four other pairs <em>7X3</em>. Pairs were elaborated on the basis of the same principle for the participants who were exposed to the opposite digit combination, that is, <em>37</em> as the <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> and <em>6X4</em> as the <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> <strong data-auto="strong_text">dependency</strong> during the study phase. The digit <em>X</em> was always selected randomly among the six digits used as target digits in the study phase (0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9). The digit <em>X</em> was the same in the legal string and in the illegal string of a pair (e.g., 640 – 604; 387 – 378). For each participant, the 16 pairs of three-digit strings were printed in Verdana font, size 12, on a single A4 sheet of paper. The distances were 0.7 cm between two successive digits of a sequence and 2.0 cm between the third digit of the left string and the first digit of the right string of a pair. There was a distance of 1.5 cm between two pairs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Procedure</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment was carried out with groups of 15 to 20 participants. In the study phase, the participants were provided with the sheet of paper containing the 20 problems. Participants were asked to look for the target digit within each sequence of 20 digits while going through the sequence from left to right. They were informed that the target digit could occur more than once within a sequence. At this point, half of the participants were asked to calculate whether the absolute value of the difference between the two digits following the target digit equaled 3 (i.e., was +3 or −3), a task that entails the processing of two <strong data-auto="strong_text">adjacent</strong> digits. The other half of the participants were asked to calculate whether the absolute difference between the two digits surrounding the target digit equaled 3, a task that entails the processing of two <strong data-auto="strong_text">nonadjacent</strong> digits. The two groups had to circle the target and the two digits when this condition was fulfilled (this condition was fulfilled in at least two problems for each participant). The participants were not informed that they would have to perform a recognition test after the study phase. Completing the 20 problems of the study phase usually took less than 10 min.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After this task, the sheets of paper used in the study phase were withdrawn and replaced by those for the recognition test. All of the participants, regardless of the group to which they were assigned, were asked to select which of two strings of three digits was part of the digit sequences viewed in the study phase of the experiment. Participants were told that they had to make a choice for each of the 16 pairs, even if they sometimes felt that they were guessing.</p>
