        <h5>For each event, you need to specify a chance representing how likely you think the event will happen. Then, you need to state the number of experimental points that you allocate to this event to represent your relative confidence. Allocating more points signals that you are more confident about your prediction.  </h5>

        <h5>You will get a score based on the chance of happening you specified and the true realized outcome of event as follows (note: the score is independent of your indicated confidence):
        <br><br>
        Suppose that you predicted the event to happen with a 0.6 chance, and it not to happen with a 0.4 chance.</h5>
        <h5>
        If the event indeed happened, you would receive a score of</h5>
        <h5>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1- (1-0.6)*(1-0.6) = 0.84.</strong></h5>
        <h5>
        If it didn't happen, you would receive a score</h5>
        <h5>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1- (1-0.4)*(1-0.4) = 0.64.</strong></h5>
        <h5>
        <br>
        Then, <strong style="color: red;">we will multiple 6.6667 to your score as your bonus payment in cent</strong>. For example, if you got a score of 0.84, you will receive 0.84 * 6.6667 = 5.60 cents on this event. Your total bonus payment of this HIT is the sum of your bonus payments over all events. <br>
