    <h4>Participants</h4>
    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      A total of 240 undergraduate students from the University of California,
      Los Angeles (73 men and 167 women) averaging 20.7 years of age
      participated in the experiment.
    </p>

    <h4>Materials</h4>
    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      Eight categories, each containing six exemplars of high taxonomic
      strength, no two of which began with the same first letter, were used in
      the present study. The eight
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> categories were
      first divided into two separate sets of four so that—for any individual
      participant—half of the categories received
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice, and the other
      half did not. The two subsets were further divided into two sets of two
      such that half of the categories receiving
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice and half of
      the categories not receiving
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice were either
      relearned or not relearned. Thus, for any 1 participant, there were two
      practiced categories that were relearned and two practiced categories that
      were not relearned and, also, two unpracticed categories that were
      relearned and two unpracticed categories that were not relearned.
    </p>
    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      During <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice,
      participants were shown a series of category names and two-letter stems
      that began associated exemplars of relatively low taxonomic frequency. The
      targets of this
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice were always
      extralist items—that is, items that were not presented during the study
      phase of the experiment. Although this procedure differs from the typical
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong>-practice paradigm—as
      <a href="#c5">Bauml (2002)</a> and
      <a href="#c26">Storm, Bjork, Bjork, and Nestojko (2006)</a> have
      demonstrated—<strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong>-<strong
        data-auto="strong_text"
        >induced</strong
      >
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">forgetting</strong> is also obtained when
      participants generate extralist exemplars during
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice. Thus, for a
      given subject, all six exemplars of a given category presented during the
      study phase served either as Rp– items or as Nrp items. The experiment was
      counterbalanced such that studied exemplars were associated with every
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> condition equally
      often across participants.

    <h4>Procedure</h4>
    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      The experiment was conducted in three main phases: study,
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice/<strong
        data-auto="strong_text"
        >relearning</strong
      >, and test.

    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      Forty-eight category–exemplar pairs were presented via computer at a rate
      of one pair per second. The presentation order was set randomly with the
      constraint that no two consecutive pairs were from the same category.

      phase immediately followed the study phase. Participants were randomly

      <strong data-auto="strong_text">relearning</strong> blocks, the order of
