      <strong>Participants</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      All participants were native English speakers and had normal or
      corrected-to-normal vision. The
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> categorization task was
      completed by 17 participants, and the lexical decision task was completed
      by 44 participants (22 participants randomly assigned to each half of the
      words). All participants were undergraduate students at the University of
      Connecticut who received course credit for participating.

    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      <strong>Stimuli</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      The critical stimuli were the 532 unique orthographic forms in the
      <a href="#c23">McRae et al. (2005)</a> feature norm database. These items
      were chosen to present the strongest test of feature-based
      representations. For the lexical decision test, 532 pronounceable nonwords
      were created that were matched in length to the words, and the items were
      divided into two lists of 532 items each (266 words, 266 nonwords) to keep
      the overall number of trials per participant equal for the two tasks and
      avoid fatigue effects.

    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      <strong>Procedure</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
      Stimuli were presented visually in 18-point black Courier font on a white
      computer screen background using E-Prime software (<strong
        data-auto="strong_text"
        >Psychology</strong
      >
      Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). We used a 17 in. (43.18 cm) cathode
      ray tube monitor with a refresh rate of 100 Hz and a resolution set to 800
      × 600 pixels. Each trial began with a central fixation cross on screen for
      1 s, then the stimulus was presented centered horizontally and vertically
      and remained on screen until the participant responded (or until 5 s had
      elapsed). Each participant completed either the lexical decision version
      of the experiment or the
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> categorization version.
      These tasks were chosen to examine basic word-recognition accuracy and
      latency in one task that requires
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> access (<strong
        data-auto="strong_text"
        >semantic</strong
      >
      categorization) and one task that, in principle, does not (lexical
      decision). The experiment was completed in one session lasting
      approximately 20 min. Before beginning the critical block, participants
      completed a 20-trial practice session. In the lexical decision task,
      participants were asked to indicate whether each item was a word; in the
      <strong data-auto="strong_text">semantic</strong> categorization task, the
      participants were asked to indicate whether each word referred to a living
      thing or a nonliving thing.
