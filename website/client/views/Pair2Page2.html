          <b>Abstract: </b>      When people make causal judgments from contingency information, a principal aim is to account for occurrences of the outcome. When 2 causes are under consideration, the capacity of either to account for occurrences is judged from how likely the cause is to be present when the outcome occurs and from the rate at which the outcome occurs when that cause alone is present, which gives an estimate of the strength of the cause. These propositions are formalized in a weighted averaging model, which successfully predicted several judgmental phenomena not predicted by other models of causal judgment. These include a tendency for judgment of one cause (A) to be reduced as the number of occurrences of when only the other one (B) increases and a tendency for A to receive higher judgments than B if A is better able to account for occurrences than B is even if B has a higher contingency with the outcome than A does. Overshadowing, a tendency for judgments of B to be depressed if A has a higher contingency, is weak or absent when B is better able to account for occurrences than A. Results of several experiments support these and related predictions derived from the accounting for occurrences hypothesis.

          <b>Abstract: </b>      In this article, the authors explored the existence of across-notation automatic numerical processing using size comparison and same-different paradigms. Participants were Arabic speakers, who used 2 sets of numerical symbols -- Arabic and Indian. They were presented with number pairs in the same notation (Arabic or Indian) or in different ones (Arabic and Indian). In the size comparison paradigm, 2 digits differing both numerically and physically were compared on the physical dimension. Nevertheless, there was evidence that participants automatically processed the irrelevant numerical dimension in different notation pairs. In the same-different paradigm, 2 digits were presented either in the same or in different notations. Participants had to indicate whether the 2 digits were physically the same. The results again showed evidence for the automatic processing of numerical magnitude for pairs in different notations. Findings of both experiments suggest that numbers in different notations are automatically translated into a common representation of magnitude, in line with M. McCloskey's (1992) abstract representation model.

The design involved orthogonal manipulations of the prevalence of each cause. <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> shows that the conditional contingency for each cause did not vary across the four conditions and that the conditional contingency for Cause A was always higher than that for Cause B. Values generated by <a href="#eq1">Equation 1</a> for each cause in each condition are also shown in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. The predicted values are higher for A and lower for B when the prevalence of A is high than when it is low. The predicted values are higher for B and lower for A when the prevalence of B is high than when it is low. This is the cause prevalence effect, Prediction 1. In the A low, B high condition, but not in any of the others, the predicted value for B is higher than that for A. The model therefore predicts that judgments of B should be higher than judgments of A in this condition alone.

Normally this plant had plain green leaves, but sometimes the leaves had an attractive gold edge much prized by gardeners. Their task was to find out what determines whether plants have gold edges on their leaves or not. The suspicion is that chemicals found in the soil might influence this, either causing or preventing gold edges. To test this, they set up a number of pots each containing one hosta, and they control whether the chemicals they are testing are present or absent in the pots. They investigate two chemicals at a time. Once the pots are set up, they wait to see if each plant's leaves have gold edges or not.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">On each page following, the participant would see the results of a series of trials involving a different kind of hosta and two chemicals, different ones on each page. At the top of the page the kind of hosta and the chemicals would be identified by code letters. Under this would be four columns of information. The first column identified individual plants by number. The second column identified one of the chemicals and told the participant whether that chemical was present or absent in the soil for each plant. The third column identified the other chemical and told the participant whether that chemical was present or absent in the soil for each plant. The fourth column indicated whether each plant developed gold edges on its leaves or not. Thus, by reading across a row, participants would see for each numbered plant whether the first chemical was present or absent, whether the second chemical was present or absent, and whether the plant developed gold edges on its leaves or not.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The instructions then told the participants that, at the bottom of each page, they would see the following two questions:
<blockquote>To what extent does [the first chemical] cause or prevent gold edges on the leaves?To what extent does [the second chemical] cause or prevent gold edges on the leaves?</blockquote></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To make their judgment, they were to write a number from −100 to +100 beside each question. Writing −100 meant that the chemical in question very strongly prevents gold edges on the leaves. Writing zero meant that the chemical in question has no effect either way. Writing +100 meant that the chemical in question very strongly causes gold edges on the leaves. The more strongly they thought the chemical in question prevented gold edges on the leaves, the lower the number they should put. The more strongly they thought the chemical in question caused gold edges on the leaves, the higher the number they should put.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Each page of the questionnaire presented a separate judgmental task (hereafter <em>task</em>) conforming to this format but with different identifiers for hosta species and chemicals. There were four tasks in all. The first chemical, that is, the one information about which was in the second column, is here designated Cause A, and the second chemical, information about which was in the third column, is Cause B.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Design</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Two variables were manipulated within subjects. The prevalence of Cause B (B prevalence) was manipulated with two values, low and high. As shown in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>, in the low condition there were 3 B + instances and 1 B− instance. In the high condition there were 12 B+ and 4 B− instances. The other independent variable was the prevalence of Cause A (A prevalence), which was also manipulated with two values, low and high. As shown in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>, in the low condition there were 4 A+ instances and 1 A− instance, and in the high condition there were 12 A+ and 3 A− instances. <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> shows that both kinds of conditional contingency are constant across conditions for both causes and that the conditional contingency for Cause A is in all conditions higher than the corresponding kind of conditional contingency for B.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The nature of these manipulations entailed that the total number of instances per judgmental task varied from 17 to 39. Instances were randomly ordered within tasks, and order of tasks was randomized independently for each participant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were tested individually in a small office. The questionnaire for this experiment was included among a set of materials for experiments on unrelated topics. Participants were told that they should ask questions if anything in the instructions was not clear. None had any questions about the materials for this experiment. Participants then proceeded through the tasks at their own pace. At the end of the session participants were given course credit and debriefed about the general aims of the research but not about the specific hypothesis being tested.</p><a id="xlm-34-1-204-ID0EBFCAA"> </a>

In the physical comparison task, participants are asked to choose the physically larger digit while ignoring <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> magnitude. Automaticity of <strong data-auto="strong_text">processing</strong> of <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> magnitude is indicated by the size congruency effect (SiCE), which is indicated in poorer performance in the incongruent condition (when the physically larger digit is numerically smaller) than in the congruent condition (when the physically larger digit is also numerically larger; e.g., <a href="#c9">Henik &amp; Tzelgov, 1982</a>; <a href="#c15">Pansky &amp; Algom, 1999</a>; <a href="#c24">Tzelgov, Meyer, &amp; Henik, 1992</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The SiCE is viewed as indicating that the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> magnitudes of the two presented digits were automatically processed and compared with each other. Some studies (e.g., <a href="#c7">Ganor-Stern et al., 2007</a>) found that the SiCE increased with larger intrapair <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference, thus suggesting also the activation of the whole number line (see <a href="#c23">Tzelgov &amp; Ganor-Stern, 2005</a>, for a discussion of this point). However, this interaction of the SiCE and <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference was not always obtained (e.g., <a href="#c20">Rubinsten, Henik, Berger, &amp; Shahar-Shalev, 2002</a>). In the present study, we look at the SiCE (i.e., the difference in performance between congruent and incongruent conditions) and at its interaction with <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> difference for both same- and different-<strong data-auto="strong_text">notation</strong> pairs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, participants also performed the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> comparison task in which they had to select the numerically larger digit.

All of them were native speakers of Arabic, who studied in a Hebrew-speaking academic institute. They participated either for course credits or payment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Stimuli</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stimuli set was composed by all the possible 28 pairs created from two different numbers in the range of 1–9, excluding 5. There were thus eight <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> differences, ranging from 1–8. Each number pair appeared in the following three notations: Arabic, Indian, and Mixed notations (including both Arabic–Indian pairs and Indian–Arabic pairs). Each of the pairs appeared twice, once with the larger number on the left side and the other with the smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 224 trials. Each number was about 15 mm high and 10 mm wide, and the distance between the centers of the digits was 6.5 mm.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the physical comparison task, the numbers presented were in one of two physical sizes: large (18 × 11 mm) and small (12 × 8 mm). Each number pair appeared four times: twice in the congruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically larger size) and twice in the incongruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically smaller size). In addition, within each congruency condition, each pair appeared once with the numerically larger number on the left side and once with the numerically smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 448 trials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Apparatus</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment was conducted on a Pentium IBM clone personal computer with a 14-in. [35.56-cm] monitor screen. The experiment was programmed in E-Prime software (<a href="#c21">Schneider, Eschman, &amp; Zuccolotto, 2002</a>)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>Procedure</strong></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The experiment was conducted individually. Each participant performed both the physical and the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> comparison tasks. The order of tasks was counterbalanced <strong data-auto="strong_text">across</strong> participants. There was a short rest break between the two tasks as well as after each sequence of 112 trials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The participant sat about 50 cm from the computer screen. The trial started with a fixation cross that appeared at the center of the screen for 500 ms. Then two numbers appeared, each was 3 cm apart from the screen center. In the <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> comparison task, participants were required to select the numerically larger digit. In the physical comparison task, they had to select the physically larger digit while ignoring <strong data-auto="strong_text">numerical</strong> magnitudes. Participants responded by pressing either the “L” key for the right number or the “A” key for the left one. In both tasks, participants were required to respond as fast as possible but to avoid errors. The numbers remained on the screen until the participant's response.</p><a id="xlm-34-2-430-ID0EBCCAA"> </a>
