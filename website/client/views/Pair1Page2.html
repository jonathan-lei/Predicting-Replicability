          <b>Abstract: </b>Many models of immediate memory predict the presence
          or absence of various effects, but none have been tested to see
          whether they predict an appropriate distribution of effect sizes. The
          authors show that the feature model (J. S. Nairne, 1990) produces
          appropriate distributions of effect sizes for both the phonological
          confusion effect and the word-length effect. The model produces the
          appropriate number of reversals, when participants are more accurate
          with similar items or long items, and also correctly predicts that
          participants performing less well overall demonstrate smaller and less
          reliable phonological similarity and word-length effects and are more
          likely to show reversals. These patterns appear within the model
          without the need to assume a change in encoding or rehearsal strategy
          or the deployment of a different storage buffer. The implications of
          these results and the wider applicability of the distribution-
          modeling approach are discussed.

          <b>Abstract: </b>The authors investigated semantic neighborhood
          density effects on visual word processing to examine the dynamics of
          activation and competition among semantic representations. Experiment
          1 validated feature-based semantic representations as a basis for
          computing semantic neighborhood density and suggested that near and
          distant neighbors have opposite effects on word processing. Experiment
          2 confirmed these results: Word processing was slower for dense near
          neighborhoods and faster for dense distant neighborhoods. Analysis of
          a computational model showed that attractor dynamics can produce this
          pattern of neighborhood effects. The authors argue for reconsideration
          of traditional models of neighborhood effects in terms of attractor
          dynamics, which allow both inhibitory and facilitative effects to
          emerge.

          <b>Experiment 1 </b><br />Experiment 1 compares recall performance of
          lists of phonologically similar items with recall of lists of
          dissimilar items. The major difference between this and other
          published studies is the number of participants. <br /><br /><b
            >Method</b
          ><br /><b>Participants</b><br />A total of 100 Purdue University
          undergraduates who were native speakers of American English
          participated in exchange for course credit. <br /><b>Stimuli</b
          ><br />The to-be-remembered items were 64 one-syllable words used
          by Surprenant, Neath, and LeCompte (1999) to study PSEs. An example
          similar list is vote, boat, goat, float, note, and coat. An example
          dissimilar list is break, sick, vote, greet, rat, and fun. Each word
          appeared in both similar and dissimilar lists (e.g., vote in the above
          example). Lists were randomized such that participants saw the same
          words but in different random orders.<br /><b>Procedure</b
          ><br />Participants were informed that we were interested in how
          accurately they could remember the order in which a series of words
          had been presented. Each word was shown in uppercase, center
          justified, for 1.5 s in the middle of the screen in 20-point Helvetica
          font. After the final word was shown, six response buttons became
          active and were labeled with the six words in alphabetical order. The
          participants were asked to indicate the presentation order by clicking
          on appropriately labeled buttons using the mouse. For example, if they
          thought the first word was break, they should click on the button
          labeled break first. If they thought the third word was vote, they
          should click on the button labeled vote third. Participants received
          20 lists, half with dissimilar and half with similar items, and were
          informed they could take rest breaks at any point. The order of
          dissimilar and similar trials was randomly determined for each
          participant. Participants were tested individually, and an
          experimenter remained in the room to ensure compliance with the
          instructions.
