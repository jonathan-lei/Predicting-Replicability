          <b>Abstract: </b>A single-system computational model of priming and
          recognition was applied to studies that have looked at the
          relationship between priming, recognition, and fluency in continuous
          identification paradigms. The model was applied to 3 findings that
          have been interpreted as evidence for a multiple-systems account: (a)
          priming can occur for items not recognized; (b) the pattern of
          identification reaction times (RTs) to hits, misses, correct
          rejections, and false alarms can change as a function of recognition
          performance; and (c) fluency effects (shorter RTs to words judged old
          vs. judged new) and priming effects (shorter RTs to old vs. new words)
          can be observed in amnesic patients at levels comparable with healthy
          adults despite impaired or near-chance recognition. The authors'
          simulations suggest, contrary to previous interpretations, that these
          results are consistent with a single-system account.

          <b>Abstract: </b> Research on retrieval-induced forgetting has
          demonstrated that retrieving some information from memory can cause
          the forgetting of other information in memory. Here, the authors
          report research on the relearning of items that have been subjected to
          retrieval-induced forgetting. Participants studied a list of category-
          exemplar pairs, underwent a series of retrieval-practice and
          relearning trials, and, finally, were tested on the initially studied
          pairs. The final recall of non-relearned items exhibited a cumulative
          effect of retrieval-induced forgetting such that the size of the
          effect increased with each block of retrieval practice. Of most
          interest, and very surprising from a common-sense standpoint, items
          that were relearned benefited more from that relearning if they had
          previously been forgotten. The results offer insights into the nature
          and durability of retrieval-induced forgetting and provide additional
          evidence that forgetting is an enabler--rather than a disabler--of
          future learning.

          The aim of Experiment 1 was to replicate

          Twenty-four individuals were recruited through a University College
          London participant database. Their ages ranged from 19 to 38 years,
          with a mean of 23.3 years. All participants reported normal or
          corrected-to-normal vision, reported English as their first language,
          were tested individually in sound-dampened cubicles, and were paid £4
          (approximately $7) in return for taking part. The experiment was fully
          automated, and the experimenter was not present in the room during the
          course of the experiment.

          <strong>Procedure</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
          At study, a <strong data-auto="strong_text">single</strong> word was
          presented on each CID trial. At the start of each trial, a mask (a row
          of hash marks ####) was presented for 500 ms to orient the
          participant. Next, a word was presented in lowercase 20-pt Courier
          font for 17 ms. The mask was then presented in 26-pt Courier font for
          233 ms, forming a 250-ms presentation block. The word was then
          immediately presented again, but this time the exposure duration was
          increased by 17 ms, and the mask followed for the remainder of the
          250-ms presentation block. Presentation continued in this way, with
          the total stimulus plus mask time remaining constant in each block,
          until the mask duration was 0 ms (15 blocks). When a response was made
          (by clicking the left mouse button), the mask was immediately
          presented for 2,000 ms. Participants then clicked a button that was
          presented below the stimulus presentation area to advance to the next
          trial.
        </p>
        <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
          There were 70 study trials in total. The first and last 10 trials were
          considered primacy and recency filler trials, and none of the words
          from these trials appeared at test. The RTs from these filler trials
          were not included in any subsequent analysis. The remaining 50 trials
          contained the stimuli that would later appear at test. For the study
          phase, participants were told that a word would flash on the screen
          for longer and longer durations and that this would make it appear
          clearer over time. They were told that they must click the left mouse
          button when they knew the identity of the word and then read it aloud.
          On each trial, the time from the onset of the stimuli to the onset of
          the button press was recorded. The importance of speed was emphasized;
          however, errors were discouraged: Participants were told that they
          should click the mouse button only when they were confident that they
          could identify the word correctly. If the word had not been identified
          by the end of the trial, then a message appeared to the participants
          asking them to try to be faster on the next trial. RTs longer than
          3,750 ms (the time that had elapsed by the end of the last stimulus
          presentation block) were not recorded. No indication of the upcoming
          recognition test was given.

        <p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">
          After the study phase, the instructions for the test phase were
          presented. We presented a
          <strong data-auto="strong_text">single</strong> word using the CID
          procedure on each test trial. Participants were again instructed to
          press the mouse button when they could identify the word and then read
          the word aloud; they were additionally told that after identifying
          each word they would have to make a judgment about the word. After
          each identification, the probe “old or new?” appeared on the screen,
          and two buttons labeled “old” and “new” were also presented on the
          screen below this probe. Participants were instructed to click the
          button labeled “old” if they thought that the word they had just
          identified was one from the study phase. They were told to click the
          “new” button if they thought that the word had not been presented in
          the study phase. There were 100 test trials in total (50 old and 50
          new trials). The selection of a word for each trial was randomly
          determined. Misidentification trials at study or test were excluded
          from all subsequent analysis. Responses were recorded on a tape
          recorder and later checked for accuracy.

          An alpha level of .05 was used for statistical tests, and

          measures factors with more than two levels.

          Eight categories, each containing six exemplars of high taxonomic
          strength, no two of which began with the same first letter, were used
          in the present study. The eight
          <strong data-auto="strong_text">experimental</strong> categories were
          first divided into two separate sets of four so that—for any
          individual participant—half of the categories received
          <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice, and the
          other half did not. The two subsets were further divided into two sets
          of two such that half of the categories receiving
          <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice and half
          of the categories not receiving
          <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice were
          either relearned or not relearned. Thus, for any 1 participant, there
          were two practiced categories that were relearned and two practiced
          categories that were not relearned and, also, two unpracticed
          categories that were relearned and two unpracticed categories that
          were not relearned.

          During <strong data-auto="strong_text">retrieval</strong> practice,
          participants were shown a series of category names and two-letter

          always extralist items—that is, items that were not presented during

          a category-plus-one-letter-stem cued-recall test for all of the 48
