        Social science has been facing for long the replication crisis -- only a portion of published social studies can be replicated by some other independent research teams. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p> We aims to evaluate the wisdom of crowds in predicting the replicability of social studies. In this task, you will read some selected materials from two social science papers and answer some simple questions about the studies' accessibility and plausibility.
