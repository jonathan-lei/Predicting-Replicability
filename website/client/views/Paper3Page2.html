      <b>Abstract: </b> When people make causal judgments from contingency
      information, a principal aim is to account for occurrences of the outcome.
      When 2 causes are under consideration, the capacity of either to account
      for occurrences is judged from how likely the cause is to be present when
      the outcome occurs and from the rate at which the outcome occurs when that
      cause alone is present, which gives an estimate of the strength of the
      cause. These propositions are formalized in a weighted averaging model,
      which successfully predicted several judgmental phenomena not predicted by
      other models of causal judgment. These include a tendency for judgment of
      one cause (A) to be reduced as the number of occurrences of when only the
      other one (B) increases and a tendency for A to receive higher judgments
      than B if A is better able to account for occurrences than B is even if B
      has a higher contingency with the outcome than A does. Overshadowing, a
      tendency for judgments of B to be depressed if A has a higher contingency,
      is weak or absent when B is better able to account for occurrences than A.
      Results of several experiments support these and related predictions
      derived from the accounting for occurrences hypothesis.
