        <h5>Our reward mechanism determines your bonus payment in a forecasting game based on both your prediction and point allocation. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For an event, we first score your prediction as follows:
        <br>
        Suppose that you predicted the event to happen with a 0.6 chance, and it not to happen with a 0.4 chance.
        <br>
        If the event indeed happened, you would receive a score of</h5>
        <h5>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1- (1-0.6)*(1-0.6) = 0.84.</strong></h5>
        <h5>
        If it didn't happen, you would receive a score</h5>
        <h5>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1- (1-0.4)*(1-0.4) = 0.64.</strong></h5>
        <h5>
        <br>
        Then, <strong style="color: red;">we multiple the points you allocate to the event and a fixed number 1.3333 to your score as your bonus payment in cent</strong>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, if you got a score 0.84 for your prediction, and you allocated 5 points to the event, you will get 5 * 1.333 * 0.84 = 5.60 cent bonus payment on this event. Your total bonus payment of this HIT is the sum of your bonus payments over all events. <br>
        <br>
        The table below shows the bonus payments (in cent) of different predictions according to this scoring method, if you allocate 5 points to the event:</h5>
